# Board & Governance Context

Status and issues with Favela Brass governance structure. Updated January 2026.

---

## Current Structure

Favela Brass runs on EOS/Traction:
- Quarterly Rocks (goals)
- Weekly L10 meetings
- Clear accountability structure (in theory)

---

## Board Members

### Active / Confirmed
- **Mirela Rampini** - procedural, deadline-driven, worried about cartório/Banco do Brasil timelines and formal continuity. Not obstructive but needs structure to feel comfortable.
- **Rolf Bateman** - committed, shows up, organiser/mediator, understands the project. Reliable.
- **Bruna Pavani** - serious captação + third sector fluency + energy. Strong addition.
- **Norton** - asks good questions, finance-oriented, Flamengo fan
- **Alberto Coralli** - participates in meetings
- **Luca** - on the board, has own NGO experience (sometimes tries to apply patterns that don't fit FB)
- **Fernando/Fernanda** - attends

### Likely Addition
- **Bruno Muniz** - financial brain, trusted by Norton, musician, low ego. Potential finance committee/treasury role.

### Fading Out
- **Sômulo** - disengaged, not turning up, not communicating. Still helped with Raíssa payments (operational). Probably expected to become president and felt sidelined. Handling it with a "quiet sulk" rather than adult conversation. **Out at next AGM anyway - do nothing, let term expire cleanly. Benign neglect is the correct governance move.**

### Parked (Intentionally)
- **Judi** - governance gold, but waiting until governance is stabilised
- **Margot/Margo** - power, momentum, and risk. Cannot invite Judi without acknowledging Margot. Waiting for an "elegant opening" rather than rushing.

## The Governance Problem

Tom is currently doing ALL governance admin:
- Every committee call
- Every meeting
- Every follow-up
- Preparing agendas
- Wrangling dates
- Sending docs

This is the single biggest shredder of creative energy.

---

## Key Battles (as of late 2025)

### 1. "Responsável Legal" Fight (WON)
Luca pushed to make Tom a statutory director / responsável legal. This was blocked.

**Why it was wrong:**
- Single-point-of-failure risk
- Governance concentration risk
- Personal liability (civil, labour, tax, criminal)
- Makes future succession impossible
- Sponsors see it as bad governance

**Winning frame used:**
> "Não podemos nos escrever numa situação de ilegalidade ou fragilidade jurídica."
> "Se a Favela Brass colapsa sem mim, falhamos. Se colapsa por causa de mim, fomos irresponsáveis."

### 2. House Works Approval (APPROVED)
R$25k ceiling approved by finance committee for soundproofing + AC at Tom's house (used for rehearsals after losing Assunção space).

**Frame:** Risk mitigation + operational continuity, not "Tom wants a nicer house"
- Neighbour complaints = legal risk
- Rouanet project delivery at stake
- Safety measures included (two exits, stair lighting, extinguishers)

### 3. Statute Revision
Ongoing. Key principle: don't bake Tom into the legal spine of the organisation.

## Board Dynamics

**What the board is testing:**
> "Can Favela Brass exist without constantly re-binding Tom into legal and financial knots?"

**Tom's job:**
- Central, but not structural glue
- Essential, but not legally exposed
- Cooperative, but not capturable

**Mirela's role:** Influential, not obstructive. Worried about governance embarrassment and reputational risk. Useful as a check IF contained by clear process.

---

## What Needs to Change

1. **Board chair who actually chairs** - not Tom running everything
2. **Someone else preparing agendas, wrangling dates, sending docs**
3. **Tom only joins meetings when the topic is strategic**
4. **Clear separation:** Board responds juridically, executive team executes

---

## Sômulo Situation (Detailed)

**Facts:**
- Has disengaged: not turning up, not communicating
- Has NOT resigned (worst version of disengagement)
- Still did one narrow operational thing (Raíssa payments)
- Probably expected to become president and felt sidelined
- Response: quiet sulk, not adult conversation

**Strategy:** Do nothing.
- Out at next AGM anyway
- No active sabotage
- No legal or reputational risk
- Benign neglect is the mature move
- No confrontation, no psychoanalysis, no rescue attempt
- Let term expire cleanly

**Line if asked:**
> "Ele não tem participado e o mandato está se encerrando normalmente."

## AGM & Compliance

- Raíssa coordinates with accountant for AGM registration
- Board bureaucracy flows through finance team
- Annual compliance requirements need tracking
- Cartório / Banco do Brasil timelines matter to Mirela
