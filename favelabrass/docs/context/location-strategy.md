# Favela Brass Location Strategy

Strategic analysis from late 2025 on where FB should operate, given the Curvelo opportunity.

---

## The Core Challenge

FB's student base lives in the favelas of Santa Teresa (Pereira da Silva, Fallet, Fogueteiro, Coroa) and attends schools in Rio Comprido. The kids:
- Walk DOWN the hill in the morning to school
- Walk UP the hill in the afternoon to go home

Any location strategy must respect this natural movement pattern.

## The Curvelo Opportunity

A large colonial house at Largo do Curvelo in Santa Teresa became available through a pizza partnership. It's huge and could host significant FB operations.

**The problem:** Getting Rio Comprido kids UP to Curvelo for weekday lessons would cost ~R$12k/month in dedicated transport - more than renting a space in Rio Comprido itself.

**The insight:** Curvelo cannot be the main school site for Rio Comprido kids. But it CAN serve other purposes.

## The Three-Step Ladder Model

**STEP 1 - Lessons at the School (Rio Comprido)**
- Zero transport costs
- Zero safeguarding drama
- 100% inside their natural daily route
- Captures the real favela kids from E.M. Estados Unidos, E.M. Pereira Passos, E.M. Mem de Sá
- Goal: Identify talent + build commitment + basic technique

**STEP 2 - Saturday Mornings at Curvelo**
- Kids are free on Saturdays
- Transport is safer during the day
- Tram/bus manageable in daylight
- Parents more relaxed
- Feels special and aspirational - "Favela Brass Day"
- The giant colonial house + pizza partnership = big motivation
- Goal: Build musicianship + band discipline + identity. Kids see older role models.

**STEP 3 - Weekday "Centro de Excelência" Inside the Favela**
- Top-tier students walk to evening rehearsals (safe, familiar)
- Commit to the big bands
- Benefit from late-night practice culture
- Preserves the "Favela Brass lives IN the favela" soul
- Goal: High-level rehearsal + performance bands + mentorship

## The Two-Catchment System

FB actually has TWO geographic catchments:

### Rio Comprido Catchment (the main engine)
- E.M. Estados Unidos
- E.M. Pereira Passos
- E.M. Mem de Sá
- Where the majority of "Favela Brass" kids study
- These kids CANNOT be pulled uphill to Curvelo for weekday lessons (too expensive, safeguarding issues)

### Santa Teresa / Curvelo Catchment (new opportunity)
- Three municipal schools within walking distance of Curvelo
- Kids from Santa Teresa favelas who walk DOWN the hill to these schools
- These kids CAN use Curvelo for weekday lessons (it's on their route home)

---

## The Refined Model

### Weekday Evenings at Curvelo
- For Rio Comprido kids: NO - too far, too late, too costly
- For Santa Teresa favela kids: YES - walking distance
- For Curvelo-area school kids: YES - walking distance

### Therefore:

**Two "Centros de Excelência"**
- One in the favela (for advanced Rio Comprido kids - they walk home safely)
- One at Curvelo (for advanced Santa Teresa + local kids)

**Three Recruitment Pathways**
- Rio Comprido schools
- Santa Teresa hill favelas
- Curvelo neighbourhood schools

**One Central Meeting Point**
- Saturdays at Curvelo unify the whole project
- All pipelines meet
- Big rehearsals, sectionals, workshops, guest artists
- "Daylight-safe" social mixing

## Why This Works

1. **Keeps core recruitment area** (Rio Comprido schools)
2. **Uses Curvelo** without transport bankrupting us
3. **Maintains favela headquarters** for advanced levels
4. **Creates aspiration and progression** through three levels
5. **Uses the huge house** without depending on it for daily operations
6. **Avoids replacing favela identity with Santa Teresa identity**
7. **No crazy transport budget** - avoids the R$12k/month trap
8. **No mission drift** - favela kids remain top-tier focus

## The Sponsor Pitch

"Favela Brass operates in three layers:
1. Music in the public schools
2. Weekend training centre at Curvelo
3. Weekday excellence centre inside the favela"

This sounds like an organization with vision, structure, and scale.

---

## Key Transport Facts

- Rio Comprido → Curvelo: 13 minutes by bus, BUT buses 007/014 don't actually go to Rio Comprido
- Without public transport, dedicated buses 3x/week = ~R$12k/month
- This is MORE than renting a space in Rio Comprido
- Therefore: weekday Curvelo only works for kids who can walk there

---

## Timeline Reality

For kids finishing school at 14:30:
- Take bus up to Curvelo: arrive ~15:30
- Lessons 15:30-17:30
- Home by 18:30

This is workable for Saturday and for kids who live in Santa Teresa, but NOT for regular weekday Rio Comprido kids without expensive transport.
