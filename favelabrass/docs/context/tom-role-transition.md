# Tom's Role Transition Plan

Strategic analysis from late 2025 on transitioning from "Executive Director doing everything" to "Founder + Artistic Director".

---

## The Core Problem

Tom operates like two different people:

**TOM A - The Founder-Artist** (mornings)
- 60-90 minutes arranging
- Trumpet / piano practice
- Creative discipline like a monk
- Big artistic deliverables (videos, scores, method books)

This Tom is the reason Favela Brass exists, the reason sponsors care, the reason the kids play like that.

**TOM B - The Executive Director Who Does Absolutely Everything** (afternoons)
- Board politics
- Governance committee work
- Finance troubleshooting
- Event logistics
- Comms fixing
- Chasing people (and chasing MORE people)
- Printing things
- Interpreting Banco do Brasil documents

Tom B is keeping the institution alive. But Tom B is burning out Tom A.

## The Target Future Role

**Ratio to aim for:** 70% Artistic/Strategic, 30% Leadership, 0% Admin

### 1. Artistic Director
- Arranging
- Artistic vision
- Album projects
- Signature repertoire
- Student musical arc
- Brassify catalogue
- International partnerships
- High-level musical coaching

### 2. Founder/Visionary
- Sponsor relationships (not sponsor admin)
- Big partnerships (Blue Note, PRIO, TIM, Caixa)
- International expansion
- Strategic decisions
- Governance input, not governance management

### 3. Systems Architect
- Design the Coda/AI organizational brain
- Let others populate it
- Create a replicable, non-Tom-dependent institution

### 4. Public Face
- Talks
- Videos
- Documentaries
- Events
- Reputation building
- Artistic ambassador

## What Tom Should STOP Doing

### Board/Governance Admin
- Every committee call, every meeting, every follow-up currently done by Tom
- Needs: A board chair who actually chairs, someone else preparing agendas, wrangling dates, sending docs
- Tom only joins meetings when the topic is strategic

### Captação Admin
- Keep doing strategic relationships
- Hand off: document prep, compliance, CRM hygiene, follow-up reminders, meeting scheduling, formatting, proposal skeletons

### Event Grunt Work
- Banners, travel insurance, guest lists, musician confirmations, logistics, emailing venues, lineup wrangling
- Should all sit with Carol or interns
- Tom: approve artistic brief, show up, don't touch logistics

### Coda Day-to-Day Updates
- Designing systems = good founder job
- Updating 400 rows manually = job for literally anyone else
- Tom: design architecture, never touch raw data entry again

## The Missing Piece: Integrator

Favela Brass needs someone who can be the "other half" of Tom - handling the operational/organizational side while Tom focuses on artistic/visionary work.

This is the EOS "Integrator" role - someone who:
- Runs the day-to-day operations
- Manages the team
- Executes the plan
- Handles problems so they don't reach Tom
- Brings order to chaos

Current candidates to develop:
- Wesley could grow into some of this (for program operations)
- But nobody currently fills the full organizational integrator role
- May need a new hire or promotion with significant development

## Key Guardrails

### Mornings Are Sacred
- No meetings before 12:00 ever
- 90 mins arranging + 90 mins captação + piano/trumpet practice
- This is non-negotiable career protection

### Family Time
- X evenings at home per week
- X mornings per week with protected creative time
- If a job design doesn't allow proper time with Thiago and Thamires, it's a bad career design

### Energy Management
- Track creative hours per week as a metric (minimum 8h to start, then 12h)
- Track delegation progress - how many responsibilities fully offloaded
