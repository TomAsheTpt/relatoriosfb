# Bad Kissingen Exchange Project

Planning for the July 2026 pilot exchange in Germany.

---

## Background

In November 2024, the Jugend Musikkorps der Stadt Bad Kissingen (73 people) visited Favela Brass in Rio. They did open rehearsals together and a parade through São Cristóvão. Big success. Germans very keen to host FB in Germany.

Full FB trip (22 musicians) is expensive - flights alone are significant. There's a Lei Rouanet project to finance this but no sponsor yet.

**Solution:** Tom goes alone in July 2026 as a pilot/advance mission. Rehearses with German kids for a week, performs at local festival (Rakoczyfest), demonstrates value, deepens partnership, makes it easier to justify sponsorship for full FB trip in 2027.

## The Model (Confirmed Direction)

### Host Institution
**JugendMusikkorps der Stadt Bad Kissingen** - using their Big Band as the core ensemble

Key contacts:
- Roman
- Matthias (kind of the boss)
- Frank (excellent trumpet player, runs the big band)

### Open Invitation
Musikschule students, local school big-bands - anyone interested can join the main ensemble. But one home base, one band, one rehearsal venue, one local organizer.

### Week Structure
The week immediately before Rakoczyfest (late July, usually around 26-28 July):

- **Mon:** First full rehearsal + sectionals
- **Tue:** Sectionals + core repertoire (6 pieces)
- **Wed:** Full band + parade practice
- **Thu:** Combine final repertoire (12 pieces)
- **Fri:** Dress rehearsal with staging
- **Sat:** Rakoczyfest performance (+ optional parade)
- **Sun:** Optional second performance if offered

### Repertoire
12 pieces - PDFs + score videos delivered in advance

Tom already has 12+ arrangements ready, at least 8 with score videos on YouTube. Germans read well, can get parts ahead of time with videos showing how to play them.

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Tom is definitely going** - funding is Plan A, personal money is shameful Plan B
2. **One lead institution** - no scattergun of school visits
3. **Need 3+ rehearsals with same group** - one day per school doesn't work
4. **12 pieces not 4-6** - this is a proper gig + parade, not a workshop

## Funding Options

- **Goethe-Institut** - helped Germans when they came to Rio, opened coffers when they found out about FB partnership
- **Rich personal donors** - good fit for this kind of cultural exchange project
- **Lei Rouanet** - existing project for full exchange
- **German consulate in Rio**
- **Bad Kissingen city/tourism** - ask Roman & Matthias for contacts

## Next Steps

1. Confirm dates (which week in July works for them)
2. Confirm UGMT Big Band as lead host
3. Get contact for Rakoczyfest organizers to confirm performance slot
4. Get instrumentation list of host band
5. Confirm rehearsal venue
6. Share repertoire pack (PDFs + score videos + playlist)
7. Draft rehearsal week plan
8. Budget estimate for pilot trip
9. Begin funding conversations

## The Bigger Picture

This pilot in 2026 sets up the full Favela Brass exchange in 2027:
- Demonstrates the concept works
- Builds relationships
- Creates content/documentation
- Makes the case for sponsors
- Tests logistics on a small scale
