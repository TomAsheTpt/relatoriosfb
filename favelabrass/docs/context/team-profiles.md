## Wesley - Musical Director

**Official Role:** Diretor Musical

**What He Actually Does:**
- Supervises all teachers day-to-day
- Runs bands and rehearsals
- Manages routine discipline and student-facing issues
- Last line of defense between Tom and parents (massive win)
- Handles instrument logistics, repairs, inventory, physical spaces
- Runs weekly pedagogy/program meetings
- On-site manager at events
- Represents Favela Brass in the field

**Strengths:**
- Reliability dialed to 11 - he will always do what needs doing
- Absolute loyalty - fully identifies with the project
- Strong musician, good enough as MD
- Excellent with people - especially tricky parents, teachers, students
- Handles conflict & hard conversations without fear
- Operational continuity - fills gaps, fixes fires
- Genuine vocation - not just a job, he lives FB

**Weaknesses / Risks:**
- No natural business/admin/strategic skillset (spreadsheets, finance, governance, marketing, planning - not his lane)
- Impulse-driven - wants to fix everything immediately, creates budget turbulence
- Has favorites / inconsistent fairness (common in MDs, needs management)
- Not process-oriented - great at action, not systems
- Still needs "Tom the stabilizer" in big decisions

**Growth Trajectory:**
- Wants to grow as MD, not move into exec/ops/business roles
- No appetite for governance, strategy, admin
- Long-term stable pillar - will not "become Tom" (nor should he)

**Organizational Function:**
He is the COO of the physical world, but NOT the COO of the organizational world.

Perfect head of: Teaching, Students, Staff discipline, On-site operations, Rehearsals, Events logistics, Day-to-day problem solving, Parent interface

NOT the head of: Strategy, Governance, Finance/admin, Fundraising, Communications, Systems, Organizational growth

## Raissa - Finance Coordinator

**Official Role:** Coordenadora de Finanças

**What She Actually Does:**
- Full Lei Rouanet compliance
- Uploads notas fiscais to Salic
- Updates Ministry of Culture systems for every transaction
- Handles payments, supplier management, payroll
- Manages budget control for operational side
- Prepares monthly finance summaries for board & committees
- Coordinates with accountants, handles bureaucracy after AGMs
- Helps submit applications/editais using AI context
- Budget forecasting and monitors spend vs. approved Lei Rouanet budget
- Prestação de contas at year-end

**Strengths:**
- Dependable admin executor - will grind through compliance-heavy tasks
- Good with spreadsheets, can maintain data-heavy areas
- Understands the ropes of Lei Rouanet admin (rare skill)
- Embraces AI tools - integrates context + AI without being threatened
- Professional and loyal

**Weaknesses:**
- Not a systems architect - can use systems but cannot design them
- Limited strategic sense / common sense filter
- Bad ideas with confidence, reactive rather than thoughtful
- Not a contributor to strategic planning, needs direction not autonomy
- Weak people skills - slightly antagonistic, reactive
- Not suitable for leadership meetings, parent-facing situations, diplomacy
- Writing style poor without AI - wordy, "trying to sound clever"
- No appetite for more responsibility inside FB (has eye on own audiovisual business)

**Organizational Function:**
Stable executor, not a leader. She is the compliance backbone, not a strategic contributor. Don't ask her to design systems or lead meetings.

## Camila - Communications (DEPARTED)

**Fired December 2025**

Was Coordenadora de Comunicação. Core problem: executor, not a leader. Could handle Instagram (short-cycle, formulaic) but couldn't independently complete higher-order work (institutional videos, strategy, newsletters). Required heavy micromanagement. Institutional video was due Q3, still not delivered in Q4 despite Tom writing the script and editing a draft himself.

---

## Carol - Events (DEPARTED)

**Left the organization**

Was Coordenadora de Eventos. Handled event logistics and on-the-ground execution.

---

## Lillian - Parent & Community Relations

**Official Role:** Parent & Community Relations Lead (part-time - has another job)

**What She Does:**
- WhatsApp groups with parents
- Individual parent follow-up
- Consent forms and permissions
- Updates about shows
- School partnership relations
- Smoothing conflicts
- Escalating only when necessary
- Delivers student progress reports to parents (Iris generates, Lillian delivers)

**Strengths:**
- Excellent with parents
- Trusted and respected in the community
- Emotionally mature
- Stable, not impulsive
- Already handles delicate issues well
- Natural "de-escalator"

**Organizational Function:**
The emotional buffer between FB and parents. Keeps parent dynamics out of Tom's life and out of Iris's life. Parents are exhausting, political, emotional - Lillian handles that so others don't have to.

**Constraints:**
- Part-time availability (has another job)
- Cannot take on full-time workload
- Should NOT handle schools bureaucracy (too time-consuming, not her skillset)

## Iris - Coda / Ops Support / Programme Admin

**Official Role:** Coda Administrator + Ops Support + Programme Admin

**Note:** Was offered Head of Ops / Executive Producer role but declined. Stays in current scope.

**What She Does:**
- Student registration and records
- Attendance tracking
- All school-level paperwork and approvals with Secretaria Municipal
- CRE coordination
- Maintaining school-side schedules
- Collecting Rouanet annual declarations from schools
- Coda administration - the system owner
- Generating student progress reports (Lillian delivers)
- Monitoring attendance data, flagging gaps to Wesley
- Internal organizer, note-taker, task-tracker

**Strengths:**
- Smart, calm, ego-free
- Already knows the organization
- Already uses AI
- Handles data responsibly
- Naturally structured and unfussy
- Not political - staff see her as neutral
- Patient, diplomatic, clear - perfect for Brazilian public-sector bureaucracy
- Natural "horizontal connector" between schools, parents, programme

**Weaknesses / Constraints:**
- Junior - should not be put in position of "telling off" teachers or senior staff
- Declined expanded Head of Ops role

**Organizational Function:**
Coda/systems backbone and programme admin support. The face of FB to schools (not parents - that's Lillian). NOT the executive producer for events.

**Key Workflow:**
- Monitors Coda for missing attendance data
- Flags to Wesley: "@Wesley, faltam dados de presença de Professor X"
- Wesley follows up with teachers (not Iris - keeps hierarchy intact)

## Wellington - On-Site Production / Logistics

**Role:** Assistente de Produção / On-site producer

**What He Does:**
- Opens/closes venues
- On-the-ground event execution
- Shopping runs (shirts, banners, snacks, supplies)
- Physical set-up, load-in, gear management
- Transport coordination
- Wrangling parents and arrivals at events

**Organizational Function:**
Hands-on executor for events. Gets briefed by Tom. Paid per event day (diária).

---

## Production Bench (Ex-Students & Volunteers)

For events, FB can draw on:
- **Ex-students** as assistentes de produção (paid diárias)
- **Volunteers** for lighter tasks

**Key ex-students for production:**
- Henri (trombone)
- Nathan (trombone)
- Marquinho (percussion)

This gives flexibility for bigger events without permanent headcount. Tom briefs Wellington; Wellington can coordinate ex-students/volunteers on the day.

---

## Teachers

Various music teachers across sites. Wesley supervises them through weekly pedagogy meetings. Quality varies - ongoing development needed.

**Key teachers:**
- Joe (trumpet, up top / Assunção)
- Pablo (trombone)
- Joana (sax)
- Anderson Clayton (percussion)
- Raffaella, Shanso, Marquinho (down below)
