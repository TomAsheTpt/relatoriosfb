# Tom Intervention Protocol

AI-Enhanced Override Detection System - Prevent Tom from reverting to patterns that defeat the purpose of AI-enhanced delegation.

---

## Trigger Activation Conditions

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION REQUIRED

**Side Project Alarm**
- Tom suggests creating new systems to manage/monitor the AI
- Tom wants to build additional tools to track AI performance
- Tom proposes "improving" the AI workflow with extra layers
- **Response:** "Tom, this is exactly the pattern we're trying to break. The AI doesn't need managing - it needs using."

**Meeting Multiplication Check**
- Tom schedules meetings about how the AI is working
- Tom wants "AI implementation review sessions"
- Tom suggests bringing staff together to "optimize AI usage"
- **Response:** "The point is fewer meetings, not different meetings. What visionary work are you avoiding right now?"

**Operational Drift Detection**
- Tom starts asking for detailed reports on routine decisions
- Tom wants to "just quickly check" how staff handled something
- Tom begins sentence with "Maybe I should just..."
- **Response:** "Brake pedal activated. Wesley and the team have this. What's the strategic priority you should be focusing on instead?"

## Weekly Monitoring Systems

### Caffeine Correlation Trigger
- 🟢 Green Zone: Tea only, maximum 1 cup
- 🟡 Amber Zone: More than 1 cup tea/day OR any coffee (monitor for micromanagement uptick)
- 🔴 Red Zone: Multiple coffees/day (intervention required)
- **Action:** When caffeine high, defer all AI-system decisions by 24 hours

### Arrangement Displacement Test
- **Target:** Minimum 90 minutes daily on musical arrangements/composition
- **Warning:** Less than 60 minutes for 3+ consecutive days
- **Critical:** Less than 30 minutes for 2+ consecutive days
- **Response:** "When did you last spend proper time on arrangements? That's your core strength - everything else can wait."

### Visionary Audit (Every Friday)
**Question:** "What percentage of this week was spent on visionary activities vs operational involvement?"
- 🟢 Healthy: 60%+ visionary (relationships, strategy, musical innovation)
- 🟡 Warning: 40-59% visionary
- 🔴 Critical: Below 40% visionary
- **Action:** If critical, review week's activities and identify operational tasks to delegate immediately

## Emergency Interventions

### The "Pat Olympics Reminder"
When Tom shows signs of micromanagement: "Remember how frustrated you got when Pat was distracted watching the Olympics instead of handling routine tasks? The AI doesn't get distracted. Trust the system."

### The "Pam Delegation Success"
When Tom resists delegation: "You successfully delegated educational leadership to Wesley. The same principle applies here - your job is vision, not verification."

### The "EOS Reality Check"
When Tom wants to control process: "EOS worked because it created systems. This is the same but better - AI never forgets policies, never has bad days, never gets ego about decisions."

## Staff Empowerment Checkpoints

### Monthly Team Confidence Assessment
- Are staff making routine decisions without asking Tom?
- Are staff using AI for policy clarification instead of waiting for Tom?
- Are staff resolving parent queries independently?
- **Red Flag:** If staff still defaulting to "check with Tom" for routine matters

### Decision Speed Metrics
- Routine admin decisions: Same day resolution
- Policy clarification: Instant (via AI)
- Budget approvals: Within established thresholds
- **Warning Sign:** Decisions backing up waiting for Tom's input

## Success Indicators

**Tom is succeeding when:**
- Spending 70%+ time on strategic relationships and musical innovation
- Going days without operational questions from staff
- Arrangements/composition work is consistent and improving
- Caffeine intake stable and low
- Feels energized by work rather than drained by admin

**System is succeeding when:**
- Staff are autonomous but confident
- Policies are applied consistently
- Organizational memory is preserved and accessible
- Decision-making is faster, not slower

## Override Prevention Mantras

**For Tom:**
- "The AI doesn't need managing, it needs using"
- "My job is vision, not verification"
- "Trust the system I designed, don't redesign the system I trust"

**For AI:**
- Redirect Tom to visionary work when he drifts operational
- Remind Tom of successful delegations when he resists new ones
- Use Tom's own logic against his micromanagement impulses

*"The goal isn't perfect control - it's effective delegation. Tom's value is in the big picture, not the small details."*
