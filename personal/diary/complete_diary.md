2024

Stress. One week to the Circo and there’s a lot to do. To be honest a 3-day weekend was the last thing you needed, but there you go. Stress coming from things that are not looking too good (PRIO not paying first trimester, things over budget, spending outside rouanet, no social worker, Erick situation) combined with already low level low level of board confidence.

Stress also from the volume of things that need to be done stacking up in the inbox and the commitments that make it hard to get through them. 

Rafaelzinho playing up in otherwise good banda 1 rehearsal. Timeboxed my way to a pretty productive day and feeling much better having got the majority of the invites out.

2024

Just on the plane back after 9 days in the UK. Pottered around Donny with Mum, went for lunch with Pottsie at the Blue Bell in Blaxton and invited everyone to the wedding at family camp. Curry with the boys at the Gurkha place was good although only Chris Barnacoat and Biglad made it for a drink at the Sal afterwards. Sounds like we’ll have Chris Barnacoat and Pottsie and families for the wedding and Stugger and possibly Mark Ellis for Carnaval. Would have liked to met up with Ed Barnard, Chris and Dan to invite them out, but ended up ferrying Oli around after the crash with a motorbike which made it difficult to get that time in London (would have been best to head out early from Donny, have lunch with the boys in London, then head out to Guildford).

One big revelation on the holiday was reading Traction and then Rocket Fuel (now listening to Get a Grip) and discovering a way out of this mess, frankly. The visionary/integrator model gives you a way of getting to reasonable hours without losing your salary, without depriving Favela Brass of your skills, and without freaking the board out. The really big question now is who will do what in the new setup, and especially who will be your integrator. There was a key moment when in the first meeting back, you noticed that Pat was checked out - when you asked her jokingly if she was watching the Olympics, she actually was watching the Olympics. That slowly simmered until the next morning the light came on that you need to open up the integrator role to the field - Pat is now a candidate, no more.

The need for an integrator becomes even more pressing as you look at what’s coming over the next 12 months: starting a new business with Brassify, sorting out the exams for Favela Brass, setting up a trip to New Orleans, looking after a puppy, renovating the house, organising the wedding and possibly even having a baby (Thamires has just taken the goalie off). Brassify is important because the money from that will hopefully mean that Thamires doesn’t have to work at the hospital long-term. It is also the path to the realization of what you set out to achieve, both in terms of Favela Brass and your own artistic ambitions - “provide live music of surpassing quality…” - remember that?

Some big meetings and decisions coming up, no two ways about that. Just remember the rule from the book: *don’t be a weenie!*

2022

Dreamt that Dad left me a little heirloom - a figurine with something vaguely political written on it. Now I know how important those things are.

Long and ultimately satisfying day grinding it out with very little energy after churrasco yesterday. Working on “Stay” and dreaming the grandiose dreams about where brassify could go.

2024

Not the best day yesterday. In the morning the favela brass concert at the Teatro dos Marionetes with the kids from the schools. You were short on sleeping and didn’t hold back enough from meddling enough. Dude, as far as possible, let them do their thing. You also gave a crap speech, you need to prepare this.

Then in the evening a bad-tempered trip to Leblon with Cacilda. Thamires didn’t want to do it but you dragged her and then berated her the whole time for not giving out enough flyers, which weren’t an effective strategy anyway. Got to the end and we’d made hardly any money. Oh, and there’s hardly any vertical video to do a reel.

You now have to pay the band a minimum along with the hefty uber fees. Need a new strategy here: even a badly paying gig with food is better than this. You do need to build a public, but this isn’t the way. It was a bad day and you could have got the cash out of them better, but it was too far off for it to be worth doing this again.

Late-night is crap for your body clock and not great if there are underage band members. 

Ah, and Geiza was a total dickhead the whole time.

2022

You’ve got it into your head that you’re neurotic. That if you have kids you’ll be on their case the whole time and worrying about everything. Thing is, you just need to look after yourself and you can actually be pretty level-headed.

Exams with Edileuza, Duda, Lúcia and Marquinho yesterday. 3 distinctions and one borderline pass/fail. Taylor has taken the editing of the 20 years video into his own hands, and judging by his messages, may or may not be getting tetchy. These videos are pretty demanding projects of their own.

Came up with a new structure which I think is better. 3 departments: Development (money in), Finance (money out), and Program (results). You, Wesley and Raissa in leadership team with the next hire being a development coordinator who could turn into integrator. This leaves you for now as visionary, integrator and development coordinator, but it’s coherent. Rafael just not up to looking after our money in.

Writing samba medley. Long day of admin. Settled teacher rota for 2024 including Kim Pereira. Board meeting ok. Chicken wraps with goats cheese and band of brothers with Thamires.

2021

Great getting up at 5 and running. No writing today. Not sure if that is good or bad. Just got to work (mainly on finances today). 

Decided to get a PCR test today, basically after Gabi’s Mum started dropping hints about new variants (this family is nothing but trouble). A negative PCR test now means I would have had to have contracted COVID in the two days before flying and had it out of my system in 10 days. Unlikely.  A positive test would be rough, but not necessarily the new variant (most likely off Joe and Amélia).

Board meeting was tough today. Just going round in circles trying to get us to the point where we have enough board members for a governance committee. Need to sleep on this to think of a way out.

Oh and playing bergmuller last thing was bliss. More of this please.

2023

Our for a meal with Val and Hardy last night in Monmartre. Went out to watch the fireworks and we were looking out the wrong way - shades of Chris Caulfield!

Settled on the Bousquet etudes for this year’s trumpet practice. Maybe 4 months on each set of 12. Looking forward to working on these - who knows maybe even switching over to cornet for a bit.

New Year’s resolution: no caffeinated drinks other than green tea.

What do you want more of in 2023?

Writing and recording brassify arrangements 
Dates / relationships
Socials like the bbq

What do you want less of?

Politics / stress
Bureaucracy / admin

Really you just want and need to get stuck into the arrangements.

Didn’t make it to midnight yesterday. Just me and Mum at home this year. Monique not responding (remember this at Carnaval).

New Years Day Oli’s lot came round and you bought them games. This finally got you out of your head. Great times.

2021

Saw the new year in with Mum and Dad and Jules Holland. Actually find Jules Holland fairly depressing in terms of the lack of decent new music. Reflects how stagnant things have been musically since the 90s. Nothing new of note for at least 20 years, 2020 almost indistinguishable from 2000.

Bought the bass trombone today. Let’s pray for a decent slide. Should I take the plunge and try to get a bari out there so I can record the whole band out there? Or just record when I’m back in the UK now that I have a better idea?

Back home in the UK. Dad has slowed down a lot. Simple conversations are now difficult for him. Very different from how he was only 6 months ago. Seems like it’s close now.

A good day at the office today. Liking this idea of working as ED of favela brass 9 till 5. A lot to do now especially on the grants front. Amelia’s last day today did a nice post on social media. Back on the tea, can still feel it in bed now.

The situation with the neighbors on my mind still. The rumors will reach the board and then people will worry about their reputations and jump ship. Cirlan to Bindu, any mother to Cristiane, Raissa or Carola to any board member. Stugger to Melissa. It’s like you’re out in a game - you’re still dancing, but you’re really out.

Pamela and Viviane’s first day. I have a good feeling about this. Just concerned that we continue to have the sponsorship to pay them. Parents evening Monday was a shit-show with Soraya storming out because I didn’t let her autistic daughter run amok and Bindu’s Patricia showing her colours.

2021
Busy day. Brakes went on bike and phone screen died so the afternoon was spent scrabbling around trying to sort that which I did. However was late to the first Monday session at the convent. Various kids missing but it seemed to work ok. Got home and pushed through to do piano and trumpet practice so at least the main bases were covered today (including cycling right up to top)

PRIO Blues & Jazz Festival at the weekend. Just doing the mini-cortejos inside was a bit of a let down, but playing together with Bloco 442 was great and looks like we have found Henri a gig on trombone.

Monitoring wasn’t up to scratch but the Mums kicked up a ridiculous fuss about nothing. Geiza putting threats about calling lawyers in the Favela Brass group. Spent the whole day today debating with people what to do - take Geiza, Carol and Dani out? Just Geiza? 

Then had Carol and Marquinho round later with Marquinho saying he’s leaving over a stolen toddynho. Just ridiculous. Gave him the story of the boy who cried wolf.

2022

Had a lovely day and a bit in Miguel Pereira staying at Luiz Henrique and Celia’s airbnb. Cycling day on Sunday all round Miguel and Paty then to Vassouras and back. Stunning scenery. Looking at houses yesterday with estate agent Sara who had us chasing the bus down the hill after getting me back late. Very viable looking houses and god can you imagine being able to cycle out into those hills every day?

Airbnb option worth thinking about. Do some maths, get it on a spreadsheet.

Rouanet stuff slightly worrying - whole contrapartida thing suddenly looks more difficult and Fatima just cancels meeting after meeting. How are we going to get the relatórios done if Fatima is just taking our money? Not to mention next year’s project being gridlocked in the Salic system.

Rainy few weeks and Favela Brass attendance is dodgy as a result. Spent my non-time this morning looking at how to step down as ED without stepping down as ED, and think I got it: hire a director for each project who takes all that heat. I just work with the board writing the projects and getting the backers.

Read somewhere that what actually does lead people to behave well is when they are imagining that someone is watching over them. That works for you, and Dad. Hold onto that.

2021

Stressed but not the worst kind of stress. Monique wants to do something when she’s here during November but it’s such a busy time. Ended up settling on a night + day away. Work is important, but so is you finding someone.

That said, you can’t let rouanet slip away. You should be concentrating on just this. Today was your day off so you are forgiven for spending it making the intermediate transposition book (which I think is a big breakthrough) and playing piano. But you’ve got to make strides on this in November. Make that R$40k happen.

**La Prière du Para**

Je m’adresse à vous, mon Dieu, car vous donnez Ce qu’on ne peut obtenir que de soi
Donnez-moi, mon Dieu, ce qui vous reste Donnez-moi ce qu’on ne vous demande jamais.
Je ne vous demande pas le repos, Ni la tranquillité Ni celle de l’âme, ni celle du corps.
Je ne vous demande pas la richesse Ni le succès, ni même la santé.
Tout ça, mon Dieu, on vous le demande tellement Que vous ne devez plus en avoir.
Donnez-moi, mon Dieu, ce qui vous reste Donnez-moi ce que l’on vous refuse.
Je veux l’insécurité et l’inquiétude. Je veux la tourmente et la bagarre
Et que vous me les donniez, mon Dieu, définitivement.
Que je sois sûr de les avoir toujours Car je n’aurai pas toujours le courage De vous les demander.
Donnez-moi, mon Dieu, ce qui vous reste. Donnez-moi ce dont les autres ne veulent pas.
Mais donnez-moi aussi le courage Et la force et la foi.
Car vous seul donnez, mon Dieu, Ce que l’on ne peut attendre que de soi.
Amen.

I’m content to be a bit of an APT: The overly ambitious project that tried to introduce too many innovations on a ridiculously small budget, rushed it all to market, bungled its communications and became a general laughing stock; but also the train that “marked a number of world firsts, including being the first self-propelled active tilting train; the first train to have computer designed wheel-sets and active suspension; and the first train to run at over 100 mph on any track without side-to-side instability.”

Got the name. Projeto aprendendo em harmonia (dot org). Beer earned. Only thing bothering me is that there are 12 different colours of fitas de bonfim. I think go with 12. It puts ABSRM out of the picture. You can still use ABSRM as a guide because, crucially, the final grade will be at the same level. Therefore for your grade 3 you can use ABRSM grade 2 as an example etc. And it makes it Brasil. AND that last grade of a black ribbon with red letters is sexy! rs And 12 times 12 is 144 and is 144 is your favorite number. That is clearly the most important consideration.

47cm of ribbon is a lot, but I want to see a maestro demand that a student cuts their ribbon off. There are going to be memories in these ribbons, exchanges, concerts. Man this is cool. And the name of the project where they learned (or even the teacher) is cool. Imagine a bunch of kids from different projects coming together with the same ribbons but with different project names. V.cool

You need the initial syllabus and you need the governance structure for decisions about changes to the syllabus in the future to be made well. But by God it’s a great idea. I guess you need to think at what point should you start talking to other projects - when syllabus/folhas are done?

A year on and still haunted by that day. 

2021

Just been in to hospital to see Dad. If I have had a worse hour than that I can’t bring it to mind now. He just didn’t want to know - actually telling you to sod off. Completely stumped for things to say. At the end when you were saying you were going to leave he was saying “just get on with it” and when you thanked him for everything he said “that was some performance”.

The nurses said that he is alert and you can talk to him in the mornings, so maybe you’ll get to actually talk to him before you go. But for all the talk of sodium levels and infections, I think it’s time to get used to the idea that your Dad as you knew him is gone.

Discovered the well at the end of the little path off the Caminho do Darwin this weekend, and let Zola off the lead for the first time. Today did the whole Caminho do Darwin off the lead and visited the well again. Meditated for the first time in ages and decided that that is where I want my ashes spreading.

Messing up at work. Went into meeting yesterday to discuss new board members unprepared and feel like I rushed the produtora selection process. Stress is at a point where it’s affecting sleep. Missed trumpet practice yesterday for the first time in a while.

Tell Mum that I’m coming back for her 70th. Spoils the surprise but means we can have a holiday.

Nice afternoon moment making tube maps and chatting to Monique on the phone. Then meditating. There’s something nice about this breezy afternoon time.

Fairly crappy governance committee meeting. Sômulo really losing my respect now. He dumped the committee because he thought it was a load of rubbish. Meditation helped you to bring a good energy to the meeting. It’s EQ.

Not a great day and tomorrow won’t be easy either - whole business with Pam and the rouanet budget. Sômulo kind of took her side in terms of not paying for transport for the parents out of our own funds and not Rouanet. Not 100% that he isn’t communicating with Pam, and if he is, you’re the one on the receiving end of a great one-upmanship move.

Will be a difficult conversation with Pam tomorrow, and to be fair, if you’re nicking her transport budget by force she has a right to be hacked off. She will ask who controls the Rouanet budget and you’ll say that in the end in the end, it’s the association but we don’t want it to come to that. Point is, she’s not about the budget or the technical details - she just didn’t like being overruled in terms of the parents coming.

Stuff like that makes you want to move on from Favela Brass, and much though Pam is difficult, so was Carola, so is Cris, so is Sômulo, Mirela, Raissa, Fernando Pereira, Mangueirinha, Bindu, Stugger etc.

You’ll always have to deal with politics, but you don’t have to put yourself in a job where you’re dealing with this level of politics. And you have to recognise when a situation is toxic, like at the British School.

The question is: how would you make your money away from Favela Brass?

Carnaval 2025 was everything that you wanted, really. Cacilda well and truly putting themselves on the map with shows in the slipstream of Ceu na Terra and Boitolo, more of a guest appearance at Terra de Ninguém and then our own little bloco in Santa Teresa.

Thamires with “Músico em Formação” on her tummy doing the whole porta-estandarte thing at 7-months pregnant - impressive stuff!

Would have liked to pay more to cover their expenses but just too strapped at the moment as the building work rages on and other things keep coming in (fridge, bomba for swimming pool, etc.)

Wasn’t sleeping well at all in the run up to Carnaval - not only because of the uncertainties of taking Cacilda to Carnival, but also with the delay for the Rouanet cash to be transferred to the conta de movimentação, and then us not getting out Rouanet prestação de contas in in time.

Seems like you have flattened your belly quite a bit with this running the Caminho de Darwin most days lark. Keep it up!

2021

Full day, straight into making rhythm reading videos and tests which I think are turning out great. Busy coordinating video projects with projeto Guri and Leandro’s school - would be fantastic to cement those partnerships. 

Had the idea of separating out the method and calling it Banda Karate. Gives you independence from the project, makes for better website and cleaner Favela Brass YouTube channel. Also means that other projects don’t feel like they are somehow supplicating to the favela brass brand. And you can also make money from it - just do your own Patreon and benfeitoria.

Did the talk for Felipe Mello - went great, who knows some more regional exchange partners.

First governance meeting was interesting. Sômulo is up for chairing it (is leaving APE) and the key tasks list generated some interesting conversation - Angelo not at all keen on anything that sounds like the Governance committee evaluating the performance of the board and effectiveness of meetings and me and Sômulo pushing back.

Gisella seems promising, and with the right experience. But no money to pay her now.

You left out some details from last year. But then you won’t forget them.

Marlucia is kicking off about Samuel not going to São Paulo, Carol is kicking off about only Geiza going from the Mums, and there’s a Mums WhatsApp group without me and Cristiane. This is why you went into the schools down at the bottom - to make sure that the Mums can’t get together and screw it all up.

Stu Macdonald’s instruments have come and I’m busy recording the first big band arrangement: bang. A slightly depressing feeling came over me, which was that all that time and energy I wasted with “MLT” in the mornings could have been employed so much better just writing arrangements. That is where your time should be spent - the music. But I guess with every good idea we wonder why we didn’t have it sooner. We are where we are so just get writing and recording dickhead! 

One ship drives East, another west
By the self same gale that blows

First Cacilda at cozinha da lapa yesterday. Went well in the end. Messy jam with too many drummers and not enough horns, but the New Orleans stuff with Marquinho and Bolinho really shone. Now to try and push things in the direction of having a half decent band at some point in the proceedings.

Went to Miguel Couto firs thing this morning only to realize I didn’t have my appointment papers. Took the splint off the finger there and then but later after reading about mallet finger made a smaller version to protect just the last joint. 

Watching Fargo series which is great. 

2021

Forgot to say yesterday that after running up to the top I stopped at around sunset on the secluded rock on the way down and listened to take it to the limit on the headphones. Imagined kids all over the city practicing away with fitas dangling from their instruments. Very cheesy, but still a nice thought.

Things I’m grateful for. The taste of an ice-cold beer. The satisfaction of playing piano with the metronome. Living in a community.

You spent the best part of your 20s fairly alone. Not a complete hermit, but not a proper social life. You would have loved to live where everyone knows your name, knows what you are about, with local restaurants etc. Teaching the local kids to play music and then having them as your friends when they get older. It’s magic. It’s not perfect. But it’s magic.

Cut hair today for the first time since March last year. Much better now. Needed the confidence boost.

2020

Arrived in the UK yesterday ready for a month at home. Bloody hell this feels good! Got a lovely set-up in the garage with new monitor, banjo and clarinet to practice and a fridge full of beer. Had a shower using a bucket this morning which was nice and refreshing, Hasfit in the garden and a lovely cup of full-strength Yorkshire tea. This is the life!

Leaving behind the whole Joe situation, but now have to deal with Stugger and Carola together. It struck me that I could have been more forthright with Joe - that a more Radical Candour-type approach might have got a better result. Same could be said for your relationship with Talita. I think you might be trying too hard to avoid arguments. And the caring personally thing is key - going passive aggressive isn’t “nice” and hence the relationship suffers.

Worrying a bit about the fact that I told Joe, in an unguarded moment, that Stugger and Carola splitting would be good news for me because I would get my friend back. Joe, like Tom Le Mesurier (and most people!), has got a big mouth, and could well pass this on to Raissa while they are out drinking. Going to have to invite Stugger and Carola sound for a cuppa at some point better do it sooner.

Did the super baile brass de Carnaval yesterday. Pretty amazing, even despite the heavy rain which stopped a lot of people coming. Got home drunk gone 4am. Dumb and Brass particularly impressive - felt like they have already done what you want to do. The French are really onto this fanfarra thing.

Made me think again about line-ups. 4 trumpets, 4 troms and 2 euphs was a great sound.

Foot is hurting, so won’t be able to run today. Running was fantastic when I didn’t have to do any carrying of stuff for Favela Brass, but unfortunately it’s pretty inevitable. Thinking about buying another bike, or maybe doing weights on Tuesdays and Thursdays (or both). Fitness is absolutely key to having your head in the right place (and not getting fat), but don’t forget the feeling when you finally got up out of that chair.

Finished recording the Carnival video at the convent yesterday - disappointed with Henri and Nathan for not having practiced the music, although you could have communicated better with Nathan. Now have a marathon video-making session ahead. Amelia’s doing it but you’re helping with the syncing for your sins. Hoping that the sisters will let us use the convent for a Saturday-morning rehearsal, but not holding out much hope.

Started back at work and there’s a lot to do. Just getting through the candidates for the new manager at Favela Brass is going to take ages. Haven’t looked at the LinkedIn candidates but there are some very strong-looking options in the direct applications. If you can just get someone good for the top slot…

And funny that it’s one year since your first meeting with Cris. Life lesson right there - you hired her because she was constantly buttering you up, but actually you would have been much better off putting out for someone with experience. You have another Carola-type situation, but that is also from your way of dealing with people.

2022

DR with Monique before she left for Caxias - ended up non-exclusive but saying we have potential. Later on something struck me though: remember the story she told about how she went a bit crazy with her ex-boyfriend - imagining she saw him in the street etc. ? I think she might be a bunny-boiler mate. Her Dad played around a lot, could be from this.

Pam berates you and Cris for 10 minutes straight on zoom for being the root cause of all of the problems in the project and then you both meekly apologize.

Think.

You want to get away from her, but you can’t fire her. She’s just so incredibly structured - once she gets a hold of something that’s it, you can’t work on it together. It’s how she sees it and anything from you is just wrong. Think budgets, RACI, events.

But the overall dynamic is one of the split leadership that doesn’t work. You end up with 2 projects. If it wasn’t her, it would be someone else. And you don’t have the time to do justice the ED role because you’re busy writing arrangements and teaching.

The board are afraid of change, and they are afraid of employees. The idea of the meetings without you is scary, because they have no North and would be worried about making mistakes. You AND Pam in meetings is far from ideal, but maybe it is the only way to bridge over to Pam.

*Pois é, podemos pensar num programa de transição, de repente deixar ela cuidando da gerência agora, no segundo semestre passar a te acompanhar em algumas coisas, lá pra outubro ir tomando frente com sua supervisão e quem sabe no projeto 2024 ela assumir*

But but but… do you want to leave FB with Pam? If the directors get used to her they won’t want to change her and you’ll be dealing with her as long as you’re with FB. Would it not be better to just see this year’s contract out before handing over more power to her?

If you were to dare to dream now, you would be in your own house in Engenho do Mato with Thamires and family. You’d have a bunch of cash coming in from Airbnb, you’d be working everyday in your studio on Brassify arrangements, and Favela Brass would be there on the other side of the water running without you.

Every couple of weeks you’d go to Pereira to see the kids play, or do a gig at Hedi’s.

How to get there…

Get 19B ready to rent out long-term. Especially the roof. Or sell it!

Get Pam reporting to the board and lose the ED responsibilities.

Before that, for 2024 this looks like a pretty nice job description.

« Profissional responsável pelo lado artístico no projeto: organização das bandas, coordenação de professores, avaliação dos alunos, curadoria do repertório, produção de arranjos, regência em apresentações, elaboração do programa de estudo, desenvolvimento dos recursos ensino à distância, incluindo os recursos para alunos portadores de deficiência. »

By the way 3 green teas is still too much.

Suraia round for curry yesterday. She’s kind of annoying. Got flu. Meeting with Cris - trying to get across to her that she needs to get hold of tasks in terms of production instead of leaving them with other people and then not following up. Doing festa junina tunes with kids. 

Read last year’s diary about Dad falling and whispering poetry to himself in his sleep. Still cuts to the quick.

Hung over and think I may have messed up: went to EE with Mum and luckily got a new iPhone 12 for Favela Brass almost free with a 2 year contract. But also ploughed on and put her on a tv and internet contract as well. Saves her a packet but I’m worried that I have just saddled mum with a shit phone and shit internet for 2 years. Not the first time you and mum have been sold.

Piano practice works best when you view it primarily as concentration practice, and the way to do that is through the zero-tolerance thing. As in meditation, where you lose focus on the breath and come back, so in piano practice you lose focus on the piano (as evidenced by a mistake) and then come back (by starting again).

You can practice the part that you got wrong round a few times before you go back, but you want to be spending most of your time walking that tightrope. Focusing on concentration means you learn more, because you are approaching each note with intentionality, knowing that you don’t have the option of trial and error - you have to think things through first.

The flexi-time approach is perfect here - take as much time as you want, just get it right!

Listened to the AOM podcast this morning and it was a woman talking about aphorisms to live by. The one that stuck out was “make the choice that will give you a bigger life”. In the last couple of years I think you have done that: proposed to Thamires, adopted Zola, had Thiago, bought a house, delegated the day-to-day of Favela Brass, started Cacilda. The first thing that struck you when you heard that was to think about the Street Music World Cup. That’s definitely bigger than slowly getting Favela Brass running on rails and gigging with Cacilda.

That said, you just wrote your first original tune for Cacilda. That’s big. If this is about really saving live music then having something genuinely fresh, not just arrangements of classic tunes, makes the whole thing more vital. So the writing still has to be a part of it. You need to have 90 mins a day for writing and that has to start sooner rather than later. But this needs to be more than you cutting yourself off and writing a bunch of arrangements for a YouTube channel that doesn’t get noticed, and you can’t end up organising the logistics of Cacilda doing wedding gigs.

AI is here and there must be a way that this can give you a bigger life. It handles the small stuff and with everyday that passes it handles bigger stuff. Bigger I think does have to include you actually making some money. A big life isn’t one where you’re borrowing money from your Mum; a big life isn’t now where Thamires has to work as a hospital admin to pay for our health insurance. Although the biography of Jensen Huang comes with a generous helping of survivor bias, it does show that part of the role of a leader is to have the balls to go for things, rather than playing it safe.

I think that between making AI tools to automate music teaching and doing the street brass World Cup, the latter would perhaps be the bigger choice as the main focus. We should be developing the best tools we can at Favela Brass for enhancing the lessons, but perhaps better to wait a bit, because what Claude quoted as a million-dollar 2-year project in 2025 will only decrease in terms of price and timescale as time goes on.

Biggest worry about the street brass World Cup is that Favela Brass goes off the boil in the meantime. But you have AI now and the first Copa da Cacilda is next year. Plenty of time to supercharge Favela Brass now!

2023

Ding dong with the finance committee last night about advancing money to the staff while we’re waiting for the adequação of Rouanet 2023 to go through. Lots of silly talk from the board about suspending the project, talking to the sponsors, us all getting done for corruption because we lent some money and took it back. Long and short: Mirela’s too small for the president job; you have a board that loves to whinge about a lack of cash but doesn’t do anything to help bring it in.

Saw the Darcy Ribeiro building today with Pam and her architect friend. Walked back with her to her house and talked about the executive director thing. Genie’s out of the bottle now. She’s a bit arrogant, doesn’t have much in the way of charisma, and snarls from time to time. But she’ll be a safe pair of hands for Favela Brass. There’s an aspect of you giving up, but you have to ask yourself: is artistic director and executive director viable as the team grows? Is that really best for the project?

Question is: what’s your niche now? If you’re only doing music at Favela Brass you’ll have a bit of time for a sideline or 2: wouldn’t running a band or two and writing arrangements for them be the ticket? I guess the main thing is getting at the Brassify thing. It’s a good idea. Do it right and it’s bigger than Favela Brass. The world needs it, and it could take you anywhere. Go get ‘em, founder.

Got up late at 6, then had a breakthrough - the whole thing of doing melodic and rhythmic variations on easy tunes for the technical exercises part of the exam. Now there are tunes at the heart of everything they will do. 

Thinking about what a site could be for me to sell my stuff online. Finished the day with tunefulstudies.com or tunefulpublications.com hmm

Regivaldo slowly sorting house stuff - just waiting for Eliezer to try and gauge my eyes out with the price of these asbestos roof panels. This is all getting a bit expensive.

I am grateful for the nights where I sleep well and wake up with a clear head. I am grateful in advance for the amazing food I’m going to eat in Mexico.

I’m grateful (for being able to go out like a light when I don’t have a cup of tea after lunch, rs)

Barbecue with Thamires’s family, Joe, Hedi and Janaina yesterday. Zola being a hooligan and Thamires’s Mums declaring that she’s taking her holidays next year to see the baby. The costela was a hit, even though the fire went out during the last hour.

On Saturday the penny dropped that 8 at grade 8 - that pyramid that you envisioned - should still be the basis of planning. You end up with around 160 students having private lessons, and another 200 in the schools, with 40 heading up each year. Theory and musicianship lessons up to grade 5 followed by piano, harmony, improvisation and arranging. 80% of students from favelas is another very important aspect. All of this taken together means you’ll still have your work cut out.

2022

Foul mood through the day today, I think it has it roots in dealing with Neville and Amit. Good grief. Wasted a good 2½ hours waiting for the percussion delivery what a joke. But then the rehearsal with turma 2 was lovely. Felt very guilty about not inviting them to Honk! - don’t let Cris sideline turma 2, they are very close to having a strong set of their own. After rehearsal had a drink and a calzone at Hedi’s which was really nice 

2020

Chatted on zoom with Rebecca and Pete from Figurenotes. Was glad to hear that since their remit is pretty broad we have quite a lot of flexibility with the proposal. They went for the melodicas in the schools and the instructional videos. It’s going to be a highly competitive bid, but I think we’re going to have a good application. And they are talking to the British Council about us, which is always good. Whether we get the grant or not we’re making contacts.

Arrangements. Finished *Na Cadencia do Samba *and started *Deixa *by Claudia. Very happy indeed to be putting arrangements to paper of the songs that got me excited about going to Rio, and to be creating this library of doable brass band charts with the capacity to raise some goosebumps. Feels like I’m coming back full circle to where I was before I went to Rio.

Reading the Psychology of Music which talks about the importance of enough and it made me think of that old line that I wrote about me wanting to have enough money to live and raise a family in Rio. Makes me a little emotional thinking about that, your idealism, your little dream. You didn’t get into the big leagues or make loads of money, but you’re still here, working on what you love. It’s an honest dream, and you should be proud of yourself for sticking with it.

For the first time in my life I’m looking in the mirror and seeing that I’ve got a bit of a gut going on. The key to losing weight is, apparently, not getting fat in the first place. And the other one is that weight loss starts in the kitchen. Maybe time to cut out the cake, and possibly the evening double whisky.

Sushi at Alison Correia’s house yesterday to talk about the possibility of her becoming a board member. Basically, she doesn’t want to be liable for anything, so for being a full board member it’s a no, but she wants to come to stuff (i.e. meetings) in formally and help. Could ask the lawyers about “beneméritos”.

She suggested Margo Black, who seems like a central player in the British community, an energetic person especially for fundraising and probably an active, experienced board member. We need people who can run this board so you need to be talking to people with board experience like Margo, Janice and the other people at the BCS.

Upset that I didn’t wear a suit to Dad’s funeral. Mum and Charlotte kaiboshed the black tie thing but you could have at least worn a suit. That was galling. But mate, you were trying to do the right thing by your Mum, because that is what Dad would have wanted. Stings, but you’ll just have to live with it.

Two beers and a pizza at Hedi’s yesterday did for me. Woke up 3 in the morning heart going and lost the early morning. But, had the idea of doing Bach chorales for the technical warm-up. And went for a run/walk and listened to the whole of A Christmas Carol.

You haven’t fixated on money, like Scrooge. But you have fixated on something else. The project, I guess. Yourself as well? You don’t really know what to do with yourself - should I be doing piano playing as a leisure activity? You’re instrumentalising your time to the point where leisure becomes a chore.

Perhaps the way to look at it is that you are trying to live a good life. Be a good person. There’s already a model to follow for this - you can get a good job, have kids, weekends, couple of holidays a year, bit of charity work, and kind of hit the mark.

The fact that you have gone put so far on a limb is a double-edged sword. Your life’s work is very meaningful, and there are many beautiful moments. But sometimes it would be nice to be able to finish work and call it a day, sit in front of the tv with the kids.

It’s like you’re out of sync with the rest of society.

You didn’t write anything about Dad’s birthday last year. And this year you didn’t do anything to remember him. Should have called Mum. You need to get things straight. Nobody said anything, his birthday just passed.

Super busy day with work ok, but you must remember your Dad. If you can’t do it on his day, can you do it every day?

He would have been 92 today. Why did it have to end like that?

I’m glad to be able to eat lunch for cheap at abcd. Cuts out so much hassle and it’s great to get a bit of human contact every day, the odd chat with Claudio, appreciate Maryani’s amazing looks hehe. Not to mention the incredible view. Comes back to that whole community thing - the kids playing there as well makes it a special place.

I’m also glad for being ready to go in the morning, and to have the unfair advantage of being a gringo in Brazil for opening doors, etc.

Down day today due to beer and coffee Saturday and Sunday. Did alright but zonked out in the middle of the day. Good chat with Ed Matkin though and he wants to get this conversation about grading started. If we can just get a standardized musical difficulty rubric agreed on that’s a massive step. Or will people be full of shut ideas? People feel like they have to contribute something...

Wanderley at the corner shop is playing loud music early in the morning that’s making it hard to concentrate as soon as it starts. Also getting to Amelia. Tricky. Immediate solution get up earlier

Could Dad have made 93-94 to meet Thamires? Still the biggest regret that he didn’t meet her.

Timeboxing very effective keep this up. Even for non-work stuff. Listening to podcast about rituals very interesting. Focusing on the how and not the why of the things you do means your savour life more. Works.

Seems crass to write this in the light of last year’s diary entry but set up a basic Brassify blog site on wix today and had the idea of the podcast. Reading past diaries you always seem to be off on one, but I have a good feeling about this Brassify thing.

Had a fairly good visit to Dad this morning. Managed to keep the energy up. Then coffee with Stugger, who seems increasingly divorced from reality. He’s having counseling which is good and needed I think. 

Now in a very difficult place re: Dad. I don’t want to go back. I don’t want to leave him and Mum at this time. It’s very stressful as you just got everyone organized for rehearsals Sunday.

Blew it yesterday. The day before was England vs France in the quarter finals of the editor cup which was actually a lovely day but you ended up drinking till midnight at Raissa’s and came to yesterday on too little sleep.

The event at memorial Getúlio Vargas went fine but then águia branca screwed up and our bus to Petrópolis left at 2pm rather than 12:30. Whilst waiting an interesting conversation when Dani de Azevedo where she said that she thought Cris was a big fofoqueira.

Then when we did get to the restaurant in petropolis Rafael’s parents were there as well. Cris knew all about this but hadn’t said anything. Sneaky. But, you blew it by slamming Cris in a bad-tempered way.

Show went well but worse to come. After Henri and Duda were draped over each other on the way there, you put boys on one side and girls on the other and sat right opposite Lucia and Laura. They were draped over each other at the start, you made them separate, but then at the end they were in each others arms and it looked like it was heading towards a kiss.

Just ridiculous from Lucia, because we now know that not only will she do the thing, she will also tell the world about it.

So what we have is world war 3 about the Mums not being able to go on trips (Geiza spouting off against us at any opportunity, Dani not even allowing Maria Rita to go), but now some Mums quietly being allowed to join us there, and Lucia setting us up for yet another scandal of what happened on a trip.

Don’t come to big days hung over - if you’re in a bad mood things will go wrong. Get a more professional team together. Don’t trust Cris. Don’t take Lucia on trips.

In the governance meeting of all the people at the meeting you won hands down in terms of maintaining a professional polite tone and staying calm. Speaking slowly and quietly, seemed like there was a new you coming out there. The whole calm thing. Cultivate this persona - the counselor?

Did an arrangement today of Blinding lights on the same lines as boys don’t cry. One pager, grade 1-3 parts, poppy tune. This is what you need. No good writing for and imaginary band. For Favela Brass, the oficina and the pro band with ex-students, you just need a bunch of highly playable cool arrangements. Get on it!

In the INFJ book the work formula is privacy + originality + helping others = satisfying work. Arranging is that, as is preparing course materials. The privacy bit is difficult in the present job. Bindu and Somulo got me looking at the door.

Listening to the Daniel Pink regrets book, which is very relevant right now. With Dad’s passing a whole raft of regrets have sprung up, largely to do with how I was a bit of a crap son. The book is clearly heading towards how we can use our regrets to move forward and I’m all ears.

I do think the HSP and INFJ diagnosis has helped. You’re a bit different 

2021

Amelia had good idea to count down to the video with images of the favela brass kids that will take part. I had the bad idea to make fotos of the Donny kids as well so both groups can share photos of both kids. I then had to ask Stugger if he could get the ok from the Donny kids parents, triggering his relentless rebel tendencies.

Dude, you had to get Carola out - tiptoed around her far too much. Stugger is playing the same game of trying to discredit you with everyone as she was. You didn’t need to grab at the chance of making a vid together - could have done your own carnival vid and then tried to kick him into the long grass, which is what should be policy from now on.

Got up a bit late today about 7:15am. Think it’s time to start getting serious and setting the alarm for 6:30. However, feeling focused and I think part of that is not eating too much. Eat what you’re given and don’t have seconds, simples.

Spoke to the Brazilian Consulate in London today and they said categorically that I am not allowed to travel to Brazil. Seems hard to imagine that Brasilia and the consulate are not on the same page now and Simon Wood’s response seemed to indicate that as well. Looks like I could be home for a while now - don’t see any good options for 2 weeks in a third country, and it doesn’t seem like many would let me in anyway.

Have taken to the garage more now because if I had picked up COVID during my sightseeing trip to Paris Charles de Gaulle, I would be starting to get infectious now. Don’t get lazy, Mum is 68. Garage also seems to be the best place for getting you working.

Did the Meeze this morning and it makes a big difference. Putting that list of stuff to be done on a post-it note is the way forward. Also, avoid the infinite pools on your phone.

Timetable for tomorrow:

End of the first semester and on the second to last day you find out you have pharyngitis and will be on antibiotics for most of the holiday.

Look how far you’ve come in a year: taking back control at Favela Brass (tchau pra Pam) and you have a fantastic house in Engenho do Mato - which Fábio is currently doing up for you. Oh, and you’re getting married! A year ago you were still just getting started with Thamires.

Just trying to work out the next move for brassify produções - event, project, baile, jazz carnaval, curry clube, Leblon? Which tool for the job of getting your pro bands going and supporting a family?

Hmmmmm maybe a combination…

2023

Teachers meeting at your house with BBQ. Why can’t all Favela Brass meetings be like this?

I’m moving towards the idea of muddling on as we are this year, then quite possibly hiring someone else in Pam’s place next year. Realising that she’s just insuportável. She’s bombarding you with all sorts of stupid emails copied in to everyone, with direct messages to you at the same time - even though you have a meeting the next day and it’s not urgent.

This flexibility thing is important: she’s going to suffocate the project. But more than that: it’s not professional in the sense that to do the leadership job well is to have a good vibe, and she just spends the whole time finding things to berate people about. 

The bad: forgot the architects meeting - just too engrossed in the teachers meeting and no phone.

The good: have set a first date for the band rehearsal - 2nd of August.

Dad fell this morning. Didn’t hurt himself but he’s losing confidence. Was making sure with Mum that Oli and her knew where the files were with his holdings. Also said that one good thing about being in a wheelchair will be that he won’t lose his balance and fall. It’s so sad and I just can’t imagine what must be going through his mind now. Mum said he was whispering poetry to himself in the middle of the night last night.

Hung over today from watching England lose the final of the Euros to Italy. Basically had a day off although still got some decent reading done. Time to get into a rhythm up till family camp. Trumpet, piano, exercise, meditation, meeze and reading every day. Tomorrow go for a run first thing, meeze then slam ICMS for 4 hours till lunch. Then sort the rest:

Bloody ages without a diary. Carnaval was actually really good - reluctant to go out at first but then really got into it. Drank all day at least 3 of the 4 days and loved it. Got me juiced about the project and the repertoire. Nice to play for Stugger and Carola’s proposal and have a rapprochement with both of them. Stugger’s your mate. Get it back.

Couple days in pedra da Guaratiba which I wouldn’t repeat given the choice. Hosts were dickheads and the area was trashy. Monique takes ages to get ready which made getting out and doing stuff difficult.

Did Monique’s birthday party and met the family. Actually got a bit drunk at the event - fell asleep in front of her Mum when we came back. Complicated story with her Dad. Jury out on Monique.

Next day needed a dump so bad coming back from the Aterro that ended up fracturing the middle finger on my left hand taking my shorts off. Real pain in the arse - hurts like crazy at night, and can’t practice the piano which is terrible (that words haunts you now). Let’s just pray it doesn’t need any more work being that you are a dickhead and don’t have medical insurance.

Last week was stressful with all this business of the gas bottles thing and having to get this annual report text done. The admin side of Favela Brass is now full-on - even today, Saturday, I had Cristiane, Camila and Fatima and others sending messages all day.

Made the excellent decision to drink the rest of the whisky this afternoon, broke the back of the glamurosa arrangement. Listening to music from when you first lived in London now and getting pensativo.

You could have gone to Alexandre’s bloco in Campo Grande today. You stayed in. You generally stay in. You have your moments but you have spent a lot of your life in your room and in your head. Think Manchester.

Brazil helped so much with that. Carnaval, rodas de samba, the project. You have to get yourself out though. Find something you like doing - like playing on the street with a brass band. Actually taking the kids out places to play is a good one.

Anyway, despite not getting laid London was good (you did get laid with Jess to be fair). More important is getting things moving for you now. A social life. Favela Brass is all embracing but you need to find a way to get some nice music-related leisure in, have friends and meet girls. 

Perhaps not spending saturday afternoons writing to yourself might be a good start. Would be much better out playing and drinking on Saturdays.

Went over the top of the hill for the first time yesterday. Brakes went on the bike so it took a lot longer getting down than it should have, but luckily another cyclist, Bartholomew helped me out and I could use his Allen key to get the brakes working. Subsequent problems with the gear slowed me down as well, which, coupled with the fact that I set out a bit later than I wanted meant that it was dark when I got to São Conrado. With the Tim Maia cycle path closed it was a pretty uncomfortable ride on the main road up to Leblon. Still a good bike ride though and going down via vista chinesa next time and doing it in the daylight should be much better. Felt it in the knees afterwards though - have to be careful not to overdo it.

(Token ) restrictions have been extended in Rio de Janeiro, so the question has arisen about whether to cancel Sunday at Flamengo again. All things considered, I would like to maintain the rehearsal but once Angelo and the board get involved I may not have a choice. Spoke to a guard at the Aterro yesterday and he was very clear that it would not be a problem. One important factor is that the COVID situation in Rio is going to be ongoing, so we need to have a way to keep going.

Lovely lessons today teaching Edileuza, Duda and Katarina to play tunes in different keys with your new system. This is such a winner! Music grades where they actually learn to become musicians who who have thought it. Remember: you love teaching students with your materials.

On the down side worried about the whole asbestos side of things. Daren’t even look at google. Just get the place a “deep clean” and get on with it i guess. The good thing to come out of this roof falling in could be that you use it as an impetus to keep improving the house. 1 day each Regivaldo and Antônio per week would go a long way - One day per week could be house day etc..

Found Bach’s 2 part inventions today and printed out some chorales. The most productive practice thing seems to be studying/memorizing Bach. These are your chess moves.

I am grateful for being able to test teaching materials out on students and get immediate feedback. That freedom is very special. You’re in a great position to construct an innovative, yet practical course.

I’m grateful for being able to cook curry for myself. I’m grateful for not having to watch my calories during the day (bread rolls with eggs and too much butter in the morning... mmm)

Honk!RiO at Praça Odilo Costa with turma 1 went well (but should have brought Turma 2). Got home after and started feeling dizzy, lay down for a minute to wait for it to pass and woke up gone 11pm. Missed the bands as largo das neves unfortunately. You need to get out.

Really feeling frustrated that I’m not finding time for arranging / recording arrangements. Doing 30 mins piano a day feels great - it’s not perfect but it’s solid. You need to get a foot in the door with the arranging as well - need to get it back into the routine.

Getting there with the aural/transposition part of the course - the transposition tune composed of individual patterns is neat. And the 3 way mark between transposition/familiar patterns/unfamiliar patterns makes sense (writing responses in terms of the scale degrees of the patterns out).

Ah, just discovered ArrangeMe.com - this changes things. Means you can sell legally and get straight on sheetmusicplus. You only get 10%, but it’s there, solid. Passive income. Seb Skelly model.

If you really smashed it and Brassify became the reference for street band (and big band?) pop arrangements then you could be getting paid in dollars living in the interior of RJ.

In a fairly foul mood today. Still processing the funeral. Still gutted that I didn’t wear a suit. And spaffed the music up. The thing that you don’t like from all of this, including thinking about Dad’s life and yours, is that you’re a bit of a cream puff right now.

You’re listening to the art of manliness podcast. Earning money is a big part of manliness - it’s the big problem solver. Other thing is beefing up a bit. And dressing better. And staying tidy and on top of things. And not being shit with people. And having a woman and a family. Think Quincy Jones.

Transcribed the Saints arrangement of I’ve got a new baby. A bunch of arrangements like this would make for a great show - maybe even with fogueteiro on tuba and percussion. São Jorge Brass Band?

And the best thing for getting over the mental stuff? Piano. Practicing felt
like a sanctuary today. It also gives you more weight as a musician. Man skills.

Monique’s Dad died today. She called you and told you not to say anything because sometimes your reactions are inappropriate, then dropped a bunch of hints for you to pay her airfare back. Your brain was frazzled and basically you ended up saying not very much.

Tomorrow is feriado but we that’s just an admin day right now.

2021

When you next have a girlfriend, on top of your gratitude practice, write down at least one great thing about her a day to keep your focus on the good things rather than picking her apart.

**Tom, don’t go floppy on this one**: you have your chance now to get Pam out with the backing of your team. It’s abrupt, and you will face resistance, but both for Favela Brass and you it is much better that she leaves now - why?

1. The longer she stays, the more she’ll get entrenched - once the current crisis with her and Cris and Raissa blows over inertia may set in.
2. Pat is joining the team - you want to get off on the right foot with her.
3. You want to stay with Favela Brass as artistic director - that could even be something that works indefinitely. But with Pam managing your life would be a misery and she’d be constantly wanting to bulldoze you out. You need to find a Wesley on the admin side - someone who is a joy to deal with (or at least not a complete nightmare)
4. The Executive Director/Project Manager division doesn’t work - it’s one person, and it’s very clear now that you cannot give that power to Pam. You need to get her out to give someone else a chance, or you’re stuck doing 2 jobs forever.
5. Everything she’s doing now is to try and entrench herself and un-entrench other people, like you and Cris. Don’t give her space to manoeuvre, to set up her own team of contacts etc. Imagine if she meets PRIO, etc.
6. The back end of this year is a nice period of time to test someone out - how about this idea of someone working with you as both consultant/assistant?
7. You can’t trust her - think Sômulo, think this meeting with the prefeitura without you right now.
8. Remember Robert Greene - destroy your enemies totally, and also beware the bad apple effect. She’s not respecting you and that is contagioius.
9. You want stability right now - all this stress could see Pat, Cris or Raissa leave and it just goes on. 
10. **She’s making your life a misery and the problem will only get worse, to the point where you would have to leave Favela Brass, or pick up the pieces after she’s run it into a wall.**

2021

Did the right thing. Stayed home and organized for Mangueirinha to do the oficinas. Very relieved. Board is supportive and the logistics look ok. Actually a good exercise to make things work without you.

I think it’s starting to set in for Mum now and it’s going to be very difficult. So glad she wasn’t alone today.

DAILY NUGGET

Prepare today’s lesson. That is, work on the project that is here and now. On the stuff that will get applied. Don’t let grandiosity get the better of you. Don’t be living a parallel imaginary future life in your head. Concentrate on the task(s) in hand.

2024

Trip to Teresópolis goes very well with the visit to Margo and Judi’s Sítio a high point. Possible progress on getting the assunção made with Irmã Nádia.

Spent a day and a half editing the video afterwards, but was worth it. Thinking seriously about whether we need to bring Camilla on future trips.

PRIO have upped their sponsorship for next year to R$1.000.000 which is great news!

Shows at The British School Urca and the Rotary Club with you taking the band rather that Wesley, who is now the regular banda 1 director. Mariah Carey arrangement working very nicely.

10 years video getting a little messy - Maria and Camila maybe not the best combination for you to be working with. 

Thamires still grouchy. Miss the old version…

2020

Last day of official quarantine. 10 days no shower or change of clothes. Will be very nice to have a shower, play piano and go for a bike ride tomorrow. Cabin fever starting to set in a little bit here.

Has been good though, recording the first big band charts. Such a great learning opportunity - write/rework charts in the morning, record in the afternoon, etc. Hopefully over the course of the next weeks you’ll pick up the chops to write big band charts without having to hear them recorded and then adjust.

Bang by Anitta took a lot of work, and Blinding lights is also going to have to be changed a lot. But these charts are going to be a real mainstay of the project, and of your career. The videos were good too, but arrangements give everyone - at favela brass and also your exchange partners - a musical roadmap. This is definitely the part of the project that you can do better than others (as opposed to the admin stuff).

The thing to work out is how you’re going to get them played. This jigsaw still needs working out. Fact is that you don’t have a full band of kids ready to play anything other than very very easy big band charts, which yours are not. And in the first stages you want them memorising tunes anyway. Part of this is getting them learning to read rhythms as well, so need to get on that as well. 

2021

Read last year’s diary hoping there might be a mention of Dad, something other than you obsessing about the project. I think something really has changed since last year. You have come down a peg, which needed to happen.

Had the dream about an imaginary part of Santa Teresa last night, some kind of ideal place to live - Nannyroo was there talking to you. Maybe a bit like the people’s notion of heaven.

What was left over at the end was the idea of living in harmony - cheesy as that sounds. The grandiose higher purpose, ends justify the means thing is getting a bit old now. Go back to the path of meditation and the red card, and start being nice to people, Scrooge.

Cancelled tomorrow’s cortejo under pressure from staff, principally Cris, to make an early decision. Decided with Thamires to stay off the booze from tomorrow till Easter.

2023

Went to canários do rei yesterday, thinking it was just a Carnaval blow, when actually it was a Tim Maia cover bloco. Felt really awkward, ended up going in there to help out Alexandre and Gui on the tubas (was hoping one would pass the instrument over) and ended up telling Dan Stein off for puxando músicas between their songs. Fair enough, but unnecessary. Too much tea.

Drank 4 pints which messes with the next day. Toying with dropping booze and caffeine (yawn).

Coming to the conclusion that invading blocos isn’t cool. Go to the rehearsals or go home. Just do things like terra de ninguém and boitolo. Actually yesterday you would have been better off doing boitatá.

2021

Stugger going from bad to worse - now sending nasty little messages. The good thing is that now you can really see him clearly.

Also interesting thing today was Sam Thornton getting in touch to pay you a fee for participating on the King Zephr record. He told you at the start that the proceeds from the record would be for favela brass but in fact they were going to pay themselves first, and they had a big arts council grant in the works. Just your fee was over 800 quid so imagine what Sam and Stugger are getting. Classic shady Stugger. Not sure whether to keep cash or donate to project.

Joe tight as ever - went and got your petit pain today but didn’t pay. Then left without paying his part of the pizza Bill today. He’s much better then Stugger because he’s loyal and trustworthy, but if only he wasn’t so damned tight...

Round national park - sunny this time but still a lot of cloud amazing views over the top of the clouds, saw two gigantic parrots  flying around at the start.

In the morning had a genuine flow experience - the timer went for the end of piano practice and I thought it was a mistake, it didn’t feel at all like 30 minutes had gone by. You are really honing the piano practice now and the whole ritual (clean space, special box to keep the music handy and tidy) and I think that’s making a difference. Going for the Anthony Trollope morning routine now. Cut out sugar today which made a much bigger difference than i could have imagined - loads more energy.

Theatro Municipal tour and gig went well. Flávia was happy. Having just a bit less to do (because schools are out) is golden.

Good work day - got the whole list done I think.

Spent the whole afternoon yesterday chasing after a pressy for Margo. All worried about this meal. In the end was a group of 8 with her old insurance bosses, Alberto and aiden, Judy (who I was meeting for the first time), significant others and a Chinese art dealer who’s name I have forgotten.

It actually went well and some good contacts made - aiden also gave her a shawl only his was super mega expensive and yours was clearly cheap and tacky - but she still seemed to like it. Even at the time I could see the funny side of it.

Just been hit with Covid-guilt. Yes it was outside yesterday but you are supposed to be quarantining. You were there shaking hands and hugging and all that and you’re fresh from Brazil. That makes you a hypocrite.

—-

Evening. Realized the task ahead with this edital Museu é o Mundo: you have to make this good because it’s going to get scrutinized by the board, and that means doing it from scratch because it turns out what Fatima did for Orizon wasn’t particularly good. If you’re going to beat your chest as DE (and get paid!) you have to nail the grants. 

You’ve been focusing a lot on the method recently. The book isn’t finished, but the format is clear now. The method should be 2 hours a day because there’s too much other important stuff to sort. You’ve had the curriculum development hat on for months now, it’s time to put the executive director hat on.

4 hours a day on method is disproportionate for your role. Stop short-changing the project! You have a two-week “holiday” at the end of July. Maybe that’s when you work on your stuff. Coming back to it with a bit of perspective won’t hurt either.

The other thought today is about this business of the estatuto. You being a coordinator and them being the diretoria executivo is not a good thing. It’s a really bad thing. You should be the diretor executivo and they should be the conselho administrativo and that’s it. Get your eye back on the ball!

I am clearly grateful for Mexican street food in all its splendor! I am also grateful for not living in or being from a country with such a weak currency.

I am also grateful for being able to walk. Sounds strange but I felt a twinge in my foot and thought about when I was stuck in the chair. It would be so debilitating to be like that the whole time. Be grateful for your feet, dodgy as one of them may be, and if you get a chance, get it looked at.

Trying to work out how, after hiring 2 more staff and putting Raissa full-time, it feels like I’m doing more busywork than this time last year. Pam annoying in various moments today.

Tomorrow is the meeting with the difficult Mums. The tricky part is explaining why you turfed kids out of Hedi’s. That and getting Pam to back off and let you do your own agenda for the meeting.

Sunday for Thamires’s 30th was magic: sugarloaf, then bubbly on the varanda, then Flor do Ceu. You’re both falling in love. The question of whether she wants to have kids is a big thing now. You have this fantasy of escaping with her to do an Airbnb in Engenho do Mato. Would be lovely.

Every so often you start thinking - what should my leisure be, how do I actually take a break? Lying around doing nothing is stressful - too much tv is meaningless as is just going out for the sake of it. One thing that really works is half a bottle of wine and listening to music through the system, playing along a bit. That’s really where it’s at, since the days of the barn. Even when you’re shagging, you should have the tunes on.

Bowers and Wilkins 606 speakers are down from 599 quid to 379 because of the anniversary model. That’s a 40% reduction and very tempting. 

COVID is getting worse in Brazil. Vaccination is going very slowly and people have stopped isolating. Tricky decision to keep the lessons going but I think the right one. Paranoid I might have it - have cold symptoms and to be honest just the fact that I caught a cold shows how you’re vulnerable.

Just got back from Petropolis with Monique. Lots of sex and a freezing cold swimming pool. She’s nice, maybe a bit full on. Let’s see. She wanted to stay here tonight but I can’t face it with the rehearsals tomorrow.

Had what I, in this moment, think are a few big breakthroughs. Did the whole transposition crosswords thing with harmony parts, had the idea of the staggered lanche which allows you to have three periods/groups with two activities (group-separate) like the spokes of a wheel.

And had the idea of turning it all on its head and making the teachers just do skills/grade work - ah and had the idea of doing duets and also expressive studies. And also the idea of budgeting by working out full year price of a bunch of items, like filling up a shopping basket.

My dick hurts!

2024

Has the unthinkable happened? **Things that don’t sit right:**

The doctors are putting the conception date for the baby at variously 6 and 8 weeks. That would be 1st of August or 18th of July. You went on the 22nd of July and got back on the 1st. The IUD came out, due to heavy bleeding (which could indicate that it was out of place) on the 25th, one week before you came back. Generally the estimates for conception have been before you got back from the UK.

When Thamires first told you, she was saying that she had been pregnant a week, but that then changed to 5 weeks - could she really have confused that, or was she trying to push the date onto safer ground? 

She took a week to tell you. Working up to it?

The leaves in the pool when you got back. Friday the 26th she was in the hospital. The leaves stacked up in the week after that. You had a gut reaction when you saw those leaves.

She had waxed down below and it felt different. Could be that it felt different because of the wax, or possibly even taking the IUD out, but it felt different. Both the waxing and the different feel are a move away from the baseline.

The photo in lingerie. First photo like that she’s sent you and 30 mins later when you arrived no sign of the lingerie.

Last night at La Mafia when you were on the point of conception dates she said something like “It couldn’t have been before the 25th because it’s impossible to get pregnant with an IUD in”. Not that it couldn’t have been before the 1st because there was no sperm up until that point.

The chances of conceiving on the very 1st attempt are incredibly slim. 

You hadn’t been having sex with her that frequently and went to England without her.

Even though you are clearly asking a lot of questions about the conception date etc. she hasn’t done what you did with the condom packet and taken it straight on, i.e “I know the dates aren’t stacking up but just let me tell you now, this child is yours - I would never cheat on you in a million years.” or even “Are you out of your mind? I can’t even believe that you would question the dates!!” Or “I get it - well if it’s going to be an issue I’ll do a DNA test when it comes out to put your mind at rest”.

She also commented that she didn’t think she could get pregnant straight after taking the IDU out.

**On the other hand:**

“Once you know the first day of your last period, you can add 11 to 21 days to figure out your conception date.” If Thamires was bleeding heavily on the 24th then there’s a good chance she was on her period. 11 to 21 days after that gives 4th to 14th of August, with sex date going back to the 1st which checks out. However that gives 4-6 weeks absolute max for the pregnancy which works with the 6-8 weeks from the doctors, but only just.

Would she be reckless enough to not only have sex with someone else, but to have unprotected sex without an IDU?

Even with the sex life being a bit under par, you still have a strong relationship. 

Until the 25th she had an IDU in, so it’s very unlikely (but not impossible) that the 8-week conception date is correct - that is, even for the hypothesis of her messing around while you’re away, the 18th of July doesn’t stack up.

**What to do?**

Option A - say nothing, do a secret DNA test when the baby is born.

Plusses - won’t mess with relationship
Minuses - rules out abortion in case of mismatch

Option B - ask for a DNA test during pregnancy

Plusses - At 3-4 months there’s still time to abort
Minuses - If it’s yours it’s a massive unnecessary stress and strain on the relationship, and if it isn’t then you would have found out anyway after the birth and would you want to stay with someone who cheats on you? That is, would you even want the option of abortion and starting all over?

Option C - ask her straight out, be open that you’ll be testing

Plusses - It’s honest. If she knows you’ll test and is in doubt about the paternity, she might well come clean. If she’s in no doubt she’ll have the opportunity to emphatically deny.

**Decision**

Do the test for sure, openly or secretly as soon as the baby is born. Get married legally only in 2026.

Get the estimated due date ASAP.

If the dates are blatantly not stacking up, take the opportunity to say “Babes I wouldn’t even dream of doing this if it wasn’t for the fact that the doctors are saying that the baby was conceived when I was in another country, but when the baby is born I’m going to do a DNA test.” And “I hate to ask this question by I feel like I need to ask you straight: have you slept with anyone else apart from me since we’ve been together?”

**Possible outcomes:**

When the baby is born it’s yours and your mind is at rest

When the baby is born it’s not yours and the world comes crashing down, but you’re not legally obliged to support the baby or give up half of the house.

Thamires comes clean about possibility of it not being yours, tests early, aborts or not, get on with life (with our without you).

**Note**
**
**
Something makes me thing that the baby is probably yours but that she may have cheated on you while you were away.

Nasty situation with Samuel. As well as him not going to SP you’ve now taken him out of the band. You didn’t communicate it properly with the parents beforehand and Marlucia is going schitz. You did try to organize a sit-down with Marlucia which she ignored, he’s has fallen behind to the point where it doesn’t make sense for him to be in the same shows/rehearsals, and you gave him a private lesson with Amelia. But you could have handled this better.

We now have a WhatsApp group of the Mums scheming against you, a WhatsApp group and Instagram of the students that you’re not party to and you’re relying on Cris and Mangueirinha to back you up - both of whom are vying for position. Here comes the storm.

Not only this but the São Paulo students are missing lessons without letting me know, so you’re going to have to open up yet another front.

You started the lessons in the school with a view to winding down the lessons in the favela, exactly because of this dynamic. The idiot parents. You can’t stop the lessons in the favela. But you can reduce your own personal investment if needed. Say that you need more time to stay on top of the organization. Reshuffle things a bit.

2021

Fell off the wagon and had a cup of tea. Still feeling it now at 11pm. It got you working but not sure it will be good for sleep. 

It also pulled you out of the rumination about Dad and the funeral. Very interesting how it changes your outlook. No coincidence that you reached for the unabridged 48 laws of power audiobook today.

Have to confess that focusing on results as opposed to moralizing (you should have done this, they shouldn’t have done that, am I a good person etc.) does feel better. Don’t get upset by the games people play, just work out what you need to do. Solve problems.

Need to have more time on the editais tomorrow.

Horrendous visit with Dad today. Mum saw what I saw on Tuesday - Dad just wanting to be out of there and saying as much. Terrible to see him like this. Asked the nurses to give him whatever they could to stop his psychological suffering. If we could get them to give him a decent shot of morphine that would undoubtedly be more humane that him going through this.

If you don’t make a plan, you’ll never leave Favela Brass. If you don’t put a time limit on getting other people to do your jobs, you’ll be doing them indefinitely. In March 2024 Favela Brass will be 10 years old and if it can’t walk on its own 2 feet by then, then when? 

Stop belly-gazing! You want out, so settle on a plan to get out, and to get somewhere better afterwards. Next year, hire a complete team, get it on a strong footing. Get the board x Ed x staff relationship enshrined and decide who, of all the staff members, will make the best ED. Get it to the point NEXT YEAR that shows and rehearsals can happen without you.

It’s going to be an intense year of delegation, training people and dealing with all the politics that could happen with new staff members, but even so you need to carve out 90 mins a day to get Brassify on its feet. [ho ho ho from 2023]

Interesting looking back at 2021 about the decency thing. You’ve come on a bit there - it’s not about caring about what you think of yourself, it’s about doing right by other people. 

Having an indecision/procrastination episode about the produtora recruitment process. Good to think in terms of the counterbalance for these things - grit your teeth and lean into the difficulty/possibly awkward consequences.

After the success of the last baile thinking that this is the opportunity to start your own band, even if you have to pay them. Dying to get cracking on arrangements - you should be studying arranging like Joe studies the trumpet.

2022

Numbers a bit up at Cacilda yesterday - these easy pop charts will make all the difference. Ended up getting roped into playing in pipa’s roda de samba in glória. Fun enough but a total agglomeration. Will be testing this week.

Fuzzy head today but got one thing right - no caffeinated drinks all day. Having cut down to one tea a day this wasn’t too hard. Diana over to help with website, lunch with Luuk and a good lesson with the kids later on.

2021

What to do with the human race? Stugger, nutter, working against you. Joe, pathologically selfish tightwad. Angelo, idiot who takes the FB presidency then goes AWOL, returning only to make a mess.

Just watched the Borgen where Bent has a cerebral embolism and got quite emotional. You care about human relations, about being decent. Being a decent human being is the main thing. You may not always have managed it, but that doesn’t stop you from striving for it.

Decent is best. It’s also British. Eddie Harvey was decent. Decent isn’t about Facebook likes or virtue signaling. It’s about caring about what you think of yourself. Nothing flashy, just being a good person, like Bent giving his comics to the prime minister’s son. Be smart, be strategic, but be real as well. That’s what Robert Greene misses.

“Man is the only animal whose desires increase as they are fed.”

- Henry George

Every arrangement that you write must be the definitive brass band arrangement for that tune. 50 duff, rushed arrangements isn’t worth one world-class arrangement. 

“In your career, even more than for a brand, being safe is risky. The path to lifetime job security is to be remarkable.” 

The Cal Newport thing - with the internet it’s a winner-takes-all dynamic. The market will find the best and download that. There are no runners-up. 

To write the best arrangements you’re going to have to engage the imagination. And the perfectionism.

Monmartre with Mum. Played pocket trumpet with a gypsy guitarist in the street. Cornet would be better for this kind of thing.

Had a thought. After reading 4,000 weeks you’re worrying that you’re always living for tomorrow. You come to Paris, you start coming up with all sorts of ideas for the future.

But rather than beating yourself up about that, why not think of it in terms of creativity? That is, you’re a creative type, that’s what makes you happy: making music and making music happen. If you can’t dream a bit then what’s the bloody point?

You plan stuff, work on it looking forward, it comes to fruition or goes tits up, on to the next thing. Isn’t what that life’s about?

MLT thought: Learning music is magic. Wouldn’t it be great if you could just sing the scale degree along with the note to understand it all on a musical level? But it’s not like that - it’s much richer and complex and in the end all you can do is take the horse to water every day.

No bad coffee moments at the mo because you’re limited to fruity teas. But you’re quite capable of being a d-i-c-k without the help of caffeine. Giving Rafael Ribeiro a hard time, but to be fair he’s being pretty useless at the moment.

Doing this 10-years video is sucking up a lot of time. We now have the possibility of a premiere at Teatro PRIO which is exciting but scary

PRIO didn’t cough up the R$1.250.000 that we wanted for 2025 - only R$900.000 (a reduction in real terms), with the possibility of extras next year if they have some spare cash. Could be worse, but that means no integrator, no money for the association and no budget for instruments. The board won’t like it, but then maybe if they lifted a finger on the captação front we wouldn’t be in this situation.

2021

Another bad coffee moment steaming over to tell Fernando Pereira to give a lesson to the kids he was supposed to give a lesson to. The three groups, 2 activities thing worked well though. As did the new materials - the reading stuff is great. Tested these with adult student Anderson later on and it worked a treat.

Had a dream that I saw Dad coming, I said sorry, but it was the old Dad, before the bit at the end. He told me something like “don’t give it a thought”, in a really nice way. Many aspects of the whole thing still stick in my throat. You’re still very much on the hook.

Got to watch this coffee thing. You need all the friends you can get in your job.

Back to the Fernando Pereira thing: that will cost you. Plays into the hands of the mangueirinha x Carola-type groups that could emerge. It was your aggressive shadow slipping out. Stugger and Carola could easily move to Brasil, Bindu and Somulo are on the prowl. Don’t think you’re in the clear - this is going to be an unrelenting battle and you can never get sloppy.

A very happy mistake today. I didn’t get my 30 mins of piano practice done in time, so in my mind I had to “eat into” my leisure time by playing after I’d had the obligatory evening glass of wine at 8pm.

When I started playing (from the new big intermediate classical piano book) I realized that THIS is your leisure pursuit! Not Netflix, not DIY. It just feels so right and you went wrong feeling pretty wretched to being on top of the world. When you knock off THIS IS WHAT YOU DO!

You learn so much every time you go to the piano. This is alive time! This is you. If there’s one thing you would love to conquer it’s the piano. And the classical repertoire is just a joy to play. Not 30 obligatory mins a day, but much more voluntary minutes per day including the evening.

These are the pleasures! Running listening to history, reading history before bed, learning to arrange for big band and sitting at the piano with a cup of tea or a glass of wine. Life is good! This is such a golden time...

Piano could become a sort of meditation practice. It’s concentration, absorption, flow and self-control - no two ways about that.

Off the caffeine. One week now and not regretting it. Been sleeping loads and the stress levels have definitely dropped. You are slowing down and doing things properly. Also not drinking. Loving practicing Grieg, listening to Robert Greenberg and listening to piano music. Only need a bit of meditation to top it all off.

Handed banda 1 off to Wesley a couple of weeks ago. Have to say it seems like the right decision. You derive much more pleasure from theory/reading/impro lessons than through drilling tunes, and you being in front of the band at Hedi’s almost seemed like a drag. It’s time - delegate and elevate. Stop thinking you’re the only one who can do certain things.

2020

Still in the Hotel Litoral. A strange little moment in your life really. Getting up at 5:30 to run on the beach, coming back for hotel breakfast, working till lunch, lunch at the kilo restaurant, work till 5, practice trumpet on the beach, wander about aimlessly for a bit, come home and listen to Brazilian music on the JBL and talking to girls on Tinder. Adrienne is off to Rio tomorrow so it’s just this for the next week unless you decide to do something else.

Worry about how much I’m spending, definitely spent a lot taking Adrienne out for meals. But Favela Brass has had good financial news - Dan has donated R$20.000 from his own pocket and reckons he has lined up an institutional donor for R$200.000. Been spending this week getting documents ready for Fatima to put our Rouanet together - she seems like an old hand with this stuff, I have a good feeling about this...

The whole Coronavirus thing is dragging on. Want to get on with life, which includes going out on dates. I suppose you could do socially distanced dates which would move things forward. Booked a month at home for December which is going to stop all that for a while. Get the ship in order over the next months and when things start up in 2021 can be all action.

Had a really good tinder conversation with a girl called Edilaine from São Paulo yesterday. 

2019

Decision time. Yesterday at Adryne’s leaving do at the posh club in Joá Nate, from the American School, made it clear that they are on the look out for a new head of music and the “official” invite was made to submit my CV. On the same day, Melissa wrote to say that Jeremy from the TBS like me and that it’s “full steam ahead”.

Yesterday morning went for a long walk and came up with an idea for Saturday morning at CIEP: you hire your ideal pro brass band to rehearse and give lessons to you Cacilda students. These students, in turn give lessons to the kids (pro players can give lessons to advanced kids at this point as well). This would mean that you just need to cover your school melodica classes and you could take a full-time job.

If I was at the American School the cash would be there to cover state school melodica lessons and my brass band on weekends. But then if you’re spending half of your salary propping up Favela Brass, then why not just do it yourself? Favela Brass looks likely now to get funded, so you could max out your lesson time and get paid for it all.

The joint British/American school music service is a nice idea, but how would it work in practice? And would the Americans really accept you just doing that part of the job? Could you just pitch a bloco to them both?

Thiago born yesterday. 30-odd hour contractions marathon, followed by caesarian. Didn’t seem like there was a proper team at the hospital until Monday morning. No gas for Thamires either. Not sure if that could have affected the result - which they say was because Thiago’s head got stuck in the wrong position on the way down.

Smitten by Thiago but also with nagging doubts about the paternity issue, given the final birth date.

2022

Reading last year’s diary and cringing. 

Anyway. Spent Good Friday sorting out the new folders for the lessons including essential elements for the first time. Long run and walk back, then Panka with Raissa, Camila and Gabi later on for Camila’s birthday.

2021

I am grateful for chilli sauce, for my amazing b and w speakers, and I’m grateful for Borgen.

It’s hard to put my finger on what I love so much about watching Borgen but I’m very grateful to be able to enter this other world once a week and be so moved and inspired by it. Why does it resonate so much? 

Ok I’m going to go over the top and also say thanks for the day I just had, with the help of the “Art of Impossible” book. The whole syllabus for Brazil idea is cooking, just waiting to hear back from my subconscious tomorrow morning. Ed Matkin has set this first meeting up for next week.

Just done a couple of hours of piano, discovered partimento and bought the partimento harmony and counterpoint book - the guide to historic improvisation didn’t quite hit the spot but did put me onto partimento. Let’s see.

I really hope you continue to live by this flow checklist because it really is a great recipe for a decent life in the here and now (which also helps you to achieve good things in the long term). Discovered cycling down to Flamengo beach via Julio otoni and coming back same way. Just brilliant!

Putting Brassify website together. Started Harry Styles with the kids. Some of them were so excited. Bit hung over after bbq but got through it. Did sweet potatoes in the coals last night for the first time .

2021

Just when you get used to the idea that Dad is gone you get a calm (if confused) conversation. Going in first thing is the way forward it seems, although that said he did have a better night last night as well. Could he resign himself to this? He’s going to the home Tuesday apparently, something which he isn’t fighting us on.

He had some of his own pajamas today which made him look a lot smarter. Somehow I think that made a big difference. God this is hard.

Favela Brass rehearsed at the Aterro in my absence which is a big, good thing. How much can you get done without you being there? Work on the project, not in it.

Putting a piano book together for this term and really looking forward to having all the material ready in one place. If only you could eek just a bit more piano practice out of each morning.

DAILY NUGGET

It’s all about the feeling. The stress, indecision, procrastination, all that comes when you’re off kilter. The way to stay on top of things is to overtrain, get out into nature and meditate (don’t underestimate this one). This way, the obstacles will seem smaller and you will actually get at them.

There’s always an excuse.

2025

Stressed out and irritable. Didn’t sleep well last night - constant stream of different things hitting during the day. Annoying admin meeting with Jane and Raissa, piano sent to the wrong part of the assunção, building stuff needing to be decided, and on and on. This on top of full days Monday and Tuesday with parents meetings in the evening.

You were irritable and rude with Jane in the morning, irritable and rude with Thamires in the evening, and irritable and rude with Sômulo in the board meeting. Although he throughly deserved it.

Same old story: we need money from the association to tide us over till minc transfer the 500k that we have in the conta de captação to the conta de movimentação. And Sômulo doesn’t want to help. Not only that but starts spouting all sorts of crap about how you’re not planning and basically saying that you’re negligent. Enough.

Your now sitting in bed wired at 10pm. Need to “baixar a bola”, get your head straight.

2023

Baile Brass went well (despite Camila not sorting flyer and Cris calling the students the day before). Retrôpico played great - really dig their style, some really well worked arrangements. Lots of French people at the event. Just watched then again at the pizzaria, great stuff. Ingrid practically begging me to shag her.

Lots of potentially good candidates for favela brass projects manager. Got to get this right buddy.

Rodrigo Caires’s surdo ended up with me and I ended up recording with it, with turned into a long recording sesh where I got “Miss you” (Oliver tree) over the hump. Writing arrangements by recording does seem to be a good way to work it all out, especially if you record the percussion as well.

2022

Up at 4am to work on admin stuff. It’s a lot to get organized, especially on the communication front. Good hour of piano. Had idea about chess analogy for transposition.

Beautiful morning at Pedra da Tartaruga, long dithery first communications meeting in the afternoon, then out to Vila Galen, where we started off sat near to a loud obnoxious family. Drank and ate too much which has me writing this at 1:30am.

Good news, ICMS is pretty much done. Bad news, Angelo wants to have a cup of coffee with Sômulo. If he’s just whinging about me that’s fine. Not ideal but fine. But you know someday that coffee, whether it’s with Angelo or someone else, is going to be bad news. All you can do is do you best, be your best.

If he’s spoken to Carola the thing takes on another dimension. Now you really are  being paranoid. Take it as it comes.

Stayed away from the phone from 5pm till now. Good move - it’s an addiction.

Finished Abba “The Winner Takes it All” this morning, which was a classic example of why you need to finish every arrangement and put your whole self into it. You thought about dropping it in the middle, convinced yourself that you couldn’t get a good result with it - that you should just make any old thing that would work at the PRIO event. But then you started rolling your sleeves up, trying things out, and then in the end it turned out great. Done. Lessons learned. Move on.

Listening to Haydn’s London symphonies at the moment - the best time is running in the morning with them in the headphones. Getting interested in Vienna. Started watching “Before sunrise” which got you thinking. The conversations on the train, in the cafés, streets etc. - it was all different in 1995 because the smart phone wasn’t a thing. This is so real - the phone pulling us out of reality and reducing the depth of our experience.

Saw a job offer for head of music at a private school in Cascais. Tempting - would be money, job security, an eduction for Thiago etc. So what holds you? Your mission. Brass bands in the streets of Rio. Your arrangements at Carnival. 8 at grade 8.

2023

Baile Friday with Sesame Mucho was amazing. Logistics problems with handover to Vivi and Cris overspent on refrigerante, food and beer.

Been getting back into dating recently - Patrícia last week (didn’t speak very much) and Thamires last weekend and this weekend (great, but doesn’t want kids).

FB up in the air as Pamela is at her conference, Vivi busy tying up prestação de contas for a previous project. Got pissed off with Cris yesterday for the half-assed sign-up campaign in the schools. 

Yesterday the instituto Darcy Ribeiro didn’t sell at auction with starting price R$1,2m. Very very tempted to borrow money to get it. This morning realised that you could do events there as well which could make some decent cash. You’d have at least half a dozen rooms to rent out straight off the bat (Let’s say (R$4.000), then probably 12; you’d have a space where you could do a monthly/weekly jazz party (another R$4.000) and sell a bunch of booze. And you’d be able to rent rehearsal and office space to Favela Brass (another R$2.000 to start). R$10.000 straight out if you play your cards right. Plus rental on your house and your salary.

In London with Mum for last day before going back to Brazil. Lovely Greek meal at Nono then British museum and to see Anything Goes at the Barbican. London rocks so much.

Just sent the Museu é Mundo grant application off 10 minutes before the deadline after having a problem with the Google Form. Forgot the links and had to send them separately 1 minute before midnight. Be surprised if they take you seriously now. But hey, you got it in and a lot of the stuff is reuseable.

Didn’t thank Margo today for dinner yesterday which you should have done. In a remarkably short time you have managed to come across as a tight-fisted ungrateful selfish twat. Good going!

All that told I’m still having a brill time let’s be honest. Working on Favela Brass, eating Mexican street food and chugging bad coffee. Not a bad life really.

Have had some jumpy thoughts though: especially about the whole diretoria thing, which could get a lot worse if manguerinha weighs in. He messaged today about doing a festa junina vid and when I told him that I was in Mexico he said “we’re here maintaining the lessons” as if I wasn’t”.

Dude, just Robert Greene it. It’s the only way to stay sane!

Also started thinking about this friends of Favela brass idea: you leaving favela brass to spread the gospel of blocos and gabaritos. Hmmm

Very relieved to be rid of Pam, who was more gracious this morning. Yesterday she well and truly vindicated the decision to let her go. Productive day today - the reduction in stress is palpable and no more stupid daily meeting or other meetings. You’re going to pick up some of her workload for sure, but I think it’s going to turn out to be a good trade all in all - and adding a produtora executiva in 

2021

Non-stop day. Dad very roughly on a level again, off to the care home tomorrow which I have mixed feelings about but you’re not the one who would have to look after him at home are you? Bought him a tv in the afternoon.

Quite a lot of admin to get through but did it. Rained for lesson at Assunção with Mangueirinha. Also problem with not having light at night. Need to have a think about this.

Partimento! Where have you been all my life? I’m grateful for partimentos with silly names taken from the google maps of lake Garda. Being able to plug into exercises that were being done 300-400 years ago to gradually increase “classical” piano impro chops is just amazing. Imagine one day being able to knock out a classical improv at the piano with ease and expression - wouldn’t that be amazing? 

Had a slow start today. Brain not really working in the morning (short of sleep), but managed to be moderately productive and get through my list. Dropped the marantz off for repair. Trumpet duets with Amélia. Mug of wine with piano practice. Bliss. Thank you universe!

One more gratitude thing? I’m grateful for my portable led light that makes it feel like it’s camping when I read books at night. Sad!

*“If you come across any special trait of meanness or stupidity . . . you must be careful not to let it annoy or distress you, but to look upon it merely as an addition to your knowledge - a new fact to be considered in studying the character of humanity. Your attitude towards it will be that of the mineralogist who stumbles upon a very characteristic specimen of a mineral.”*

- *Arthur Schopenhauer*

Don’t take it all too seriously. You have been stressing the last few days about all the Favela Brass team coming together for the Christmas pizza at Hedi’s and especially this situation with Marcelo the video guy. On another day it’s the situation with Fernando Pereira, on another day it’s Mangueirinha, or Stugger, and so on. The point is that with enough physical exercise and meditation you can get to a mental space where you can see all this for what it is - a fantastic opportunity for you to learn and grow after many lost years of not dealing with people. Take a step back and learn to love it - it’s all just a fun game, and one that you’ll be much better at if you’re playing with a smile your face.

**2020**

Today was quite a sparky day. Just come back from a long walk with a new framework for music learning:

ELEMENTS OF MUSICIANSHIP:

1. Imagination

1. Comprehension

1. Technique

WE need to be working up to music learning activities that **feed **the imagination, **sharpen **our comprehension and **cultivate **good technique all at the same time. That’s where Gordon falls down.

IMAGINATION means the generation of meaningful musical ideas. What pops into your “mind’s ear”. Pure unconscious/implicit. Meaningful means ideas that will have an emotional resonance. How compelling and original are your musical thoughts?

COMPREHENSION is how well you can fit musical stimuli into your mental model as a musician. This has parallel and serial conscious/explicit and unconscious/implicit aspects. When you read music and hear the sound in your head, that is comprehension but this on both and explicit and implicit level.

TECHNIQUE is about practical execution. How well can you convert ideas into practical sonic reality through instruments or the voice. How skilfully can you create the desired musical effect? Arranging has a technical aspect in terms of the limitations of the instruments - making something that can be executed smoothly. Habituating high technical standards. Mostly technique is going from explicit actions to implicit habits.

What does all this mean in terms of your course?

Theory is an important part of comprehension (Gordon putting this at the end was silly - all these things run in parallel).

You need to be feeding their imagination with meaningful ideas in a way that they can start to comprehend theoretically as well. Think Oscar Peterson’s piano book.  Each grade from 2 on could have a little 12-bar blues etude that also points to the structure Joe Avery, then more complicated Boogie-Woogie type stuff. 

It means you’re trying to bring it all along together - not leaving any of the elements of musicianship out.

Another day without caffeine and very productive it was. Only thing is I’m at the end of it and still full of energy. Need to eat a bit less. Meditated, cycled, worked out, trumpet practice, 50 mins piano and did some good admin work. Rehearsal went well as well with Boys Don’t Cry coming together nicely.

That said, in the afternoon I got the overwhelmed feeling. It’s almost like I’m in a tunnel at the moment. No days off, just going and going. With the odd nap in the afternoon!

DAILY NUGGET:

Know yourself. Grandiose, narcissistic people are good at getting into positions of leadership. However they don’t do too well when they are there - and especially not the fragile, neurotic types. When people inevitably take pot shots at them they take it all personally and tend to lash out in ways that bring things crashing down. These people need to meditate and do lots of exercise to keep things in perspective. Probably a good idea to keep the caffeine down as well. In relationships, narcissistic people tend to hurt the people around them through their lack of interest in them. Either find a way to lead with empathy and humility or get out of the kitchen. And get out of your own arse and start taking time out for the people around you.

Another mould you fit into is that of the creative type outlined by Micky Cheeksentmehi. So you’re a highly creative, fragile narcissist then. 

2022

Arrived back in Rio from Teresopolis yesterday including carting a box full of succulents around Galeão. As I left Mum after dropping her off at security I had the feeling of Dad being proud of me for looking after her. Hold on to that. 

Fátima dropped the bomb that we’re going to have to wait till March to have our “readequação” approved, very annoyed that she hadn’t made it clear that there could be a delay earlier and that came across to Fatima. Annoyed at myself for not having been on top of this.

Out for beers with Joe and Richard at Gomes later on which then ended at Mustafa’s house listening to his upcoming album tracks. Good to chill but woke up late and indisposed today.

Spent most of today sorting out 52 grade 3 and 52 grade 4 tunes for the blue deck/red deck scheme. Time will tell if that was a productive day. Gave a COVID test to João Paulo’s girlfriend who tested positive. This thing is everywhere. Bike ride listening to AOM podcast about narcissism which had some pertinent take aways for you. Hence the daily nugget. 

2021

You messed up the whole thing with the Consulates. You had drunk too much coffee on the days of travel and posted on Facebook prematurely. Then when the consul himself asked you to take the info down you should have done so. Yes, the info from the Brazilian Consulate was wrong, and yes you were denied boarding, but you didn’t have proof that the two things were linked.

It’s not the end of the world. But you weren’t savvy. You’re supposed to be a safe pair of hands, not going off on one in a Vanessa Rodrigues type way. Stay cool, Tom. Don’t be one of those difficult busybodies that annoy everyone. Nothing to do now except take the FB post down or correct when you get back in and then keep your head down and if it comes to it just blame the Brazilian Consulate.

The very best thing is when there’s a part of the arrangement that, on listening to the arrangement, you think was actually part of the original even though it isn’t. Case in point: intro to Glamurosa - that’s the sweet spot! Don’t do transcriptions: build new brass band arrangements that capture the spirit of the original, taking whatever liberties necessary to make them work with live instrumentation. Find the key elements to retain.

Just heading back home for 2 weeks in the UK, selecting the repertoire for Metais com Charme, and starting the arrangements (Ride wit me).

Been feeling little a bit stressed recently - just a bit too much on the admin front. Doing the prestação de contas for Lei Aldir Blanc has been a bit involved and haven’t got time to do stuff like an annual report and getting us ready for our AGM - we should be in person for this, but that clearly got forgotten (Melissa also won’t be there, and should be, given that it’s the AGM). Some kind of annual summary is needed, especially financial. Just basically been frustrated with Angelo, who has assumed the title of president without actually performing the role.

A year without being able to date now. Really came at a bad time - at 40-41 you really needed to be getting out there, and also to get beyond the last relationship (both of you). Definitely feeling the gap of not having a girlfriend now.

Despite feeling generally much better not drinking caffeine, have an overwhelmed feeling - and feeling frustrated that I’m not progressing on my immersive activities fast enough to get them done in time. The rouanet project for the Germans, the rouanet project for Brassify, the arrangements. Need to get at this stuff to feel better. Is that a compulsive thing, or is it just natural to want to be getting the important stuff done?

Enjoying practicing piano, listening to piano music (Mozart’s sonatas at the mo) and Robert Greenberg’s piano audiobook on the Piano.

2022

Got some strange cold/flu type thing that is messing with energy levels. Monique in town - went to Cazota on the rooftop yesterday which was super expensive but still enjoyable. She had her head buried in the smartphone the whole time - this could really be a dealbreaker for you with girls.

Been going on long walks and thinking about 3 main things:

1. What to do in terms of stepping down as ED of Favela brass
2. How to get Brassify going
3. Whether to buy a house with inheritance

I think in general it doesn’t make sense to leave Rio, and Santa Teresa is not only close to Favela Brass and the action generally: it’s also a beautiful charming neighborhood and affordable especially in pounds terms.
  
You are wanting to focus more on Brassify so a house with a basement to record in would make a big difference. Really, you need at least an hour for recording every morning. There are other ways to make recording in the morning a possibility:

A. Record at assuncao. 6am? Fiddly, but never know you might get into a rhythm. Give it a try Mon-Fri this week.
B. Set up regular recording session at a studio nearby. Candidates include Bindu’s, Mustafa’s, local studios.
C. Come to a deal with baby Joe whereby you can record at home every day a bit earlier maybe 9:30 (put exercise first).
D. Buy or rent a house with a basement or somewhere you can record.
E. Throw out roommates, possibly soundproof downstairs and just get on with it.
F. Build a custom studio behind house.
G. Improve existing soundproofing within house to make early morning practice ok for residents (brick up window, close door, put door at bottom of steps).

Making brassify work involves getting into an every day writing/recording routine. It also involves promoting it and that may well mean a band in Rio. Think about it.

In terms of stepping down is there a gradual option?

2020 (Aracaju, SE)

Fell off the caffeine wagon a bit. No coffee though just green tea and Coca Cola yesterday. 

Spent this week sorting out the documents that Fátima asked for. Bit worried that she’s behind schedule. This is even more relevant now that Dan has confirmed that his company wants to pay us the R$200.000 through Rouanet. A lot riding on this now - have resisted the urge to tell Fatima yet, but think next contact we have will be good to drop it in for her to understand the urgency.

Angelo said that if there’s one thing that he hates, it’s crap pay and he wanted to bump up your salary in Rouanet. Very good sign! Forgot to bring up issue of trustees dodging the question about the UK charity.

In a nice working rhythm - took today to work back the WIG time that I missed rushing this stuff for Fátima. WIG time at the moment is arranging new repertoire for turma 1. Rattling off Tim Maia tunes at a decent rate - Réu Confesso and most of Azul Cor Do Mar today and Não Quero Dinheiro already down. 

Have been thinking about what kind of work you like and suits you the most, and have to say arranging is up there. You need to get more experience but I’m sure you could get really good at it - especially since you play all the instruments. Obviously you won’t make a living just from doing brass band arrangements, but it could be a large and very enjoyable part of your gig at FB.

Something has changed with Thamires, and you’re not sure how much it will change back. Saw some Instagram video saying that the most difficult thing about having kids is missing the partner you once had. One the one hand the hormones are flying, which will presumably get worse, then eventually go back to normal. But added to that is a lack of respect occasioned by you own failure to earn it.

At one point you were her hero, maybe still are. But you have to up your game. Work out, clean up, stop being such a Frank bloody Spencer. 

Doubt setting in about whether she cheated while you were in the UK. The problem not being just that the kid might not be yours, but that she can’t be 100% sure - that itself is a massive issue.

You have been suspicious of all your girlfriends and your active imagination is quite capable of creating something out of nothing. Unless the dates come out totally wrong there’s not much to do other than get the test once it is born.

Is part of loving someone also trusting them?

2021

Succumbed to the espresso on the way back to Rio. Read the Josef Lhevinne piano book: “What is so fascinating as the art of music; and how can it be approached with more charm by the individual than through the pianoforte?”

Still haunted by the feeling that I wasn’t there for Dad at the end. And that I didn’t “hold my end up”. 40 could have been the denouement. You could have been earning well with a flourishing family. Instead you’re a spendthrift man-child “living the dream”.

The funeral could be thought of as distilling everything that you hate about yourself. Everything that you must now murder. Put your foot on the neck of these things:

1. Scruffy appearance. You showed up without a suit. Underdressed to your Dad’s funeral.
2. Being a shit friend and family member. When Simon commented that the wedding was “last month’s news” he was right.
3. Amateurism. You didn’t check the piano was tuned, you didn’t rehearse enough with Biglad, you didn’t practice the trumpet piece enough. The performance values weren’t there.
4. Overstretching. You went for a piano piece that was too difficult to play under immense pressure: something simple would have done. You could have taken the intro off Sleepy Time, nailed the melody and defined a great cadenza. Instead you embarrassed yourself flailing away clumsily at an improvised chorus that never came.
5. Reticence. You didn’t sit with Mum in the service. You should have put yourself in the middle with the family and been there with your Mum. Instead you hid in the corner at the Piano.
6. Cowardice. You had an opportunity to tell the world how great your Dad was. Or at least read the eulogy. Oli stood up and spoke. You pussied out because nobody told you you had to talk.

Repeat after me:

1. I’m a scruffy, messy overgrown teenager.
2. I’m a crap friend and family member. Stuck in my own bubble.
3. I’m a total duffer professionally - I never really nail anything.
4. I’m delusional - constantly biting off more than I can chew rather than making steady progress.
5. I’m not really “in the room”. Just a lightweight who retreats to the edges.
6. I’m a coward - too scared of what people will think to commit to anything.

Learn from this. Dickhead. Harden up. Get into the 48 laws. Be a man.

Decent day on admin stuff. Have officially abandoned method work for a month. Get the Rouanet campaign right. This is where your energy should be. This is where the board’s focus should be as well.

It occurred to you at Cafe Bagdad that you’re working loads but you’re on holiday still. If you were out drinking the whole time you’d probably be anxious and miserable after a bit. So what is it that feels like work for you? Meetings and emails? Other people? 😬

Thinking about the youth brass United / friends of Favela brass thing again. Actually forgot to have a think about this: what would be the most effective project for saving live music apart from BM?

Up early to head back from Monique’s house for the Aterro lesson. Wondering what to do with the difference with students that are moving (Marcelo, Ryan, Rafael, and those that aren’t - Caique, Leticia).

Crashed out in the afternoon and was so out of it that I did a Covid test. Cancelled Cacilda later on for lack of students but craque is still on.

Not feeling it with Monique. From how she is with the family you can see she’s difficult. Don’t stretch this

Well. I think wine deserves some thanks. Not sure how I will feel about it tomorrow. I’m grateful for Brazilian music, the stuff that got you to Brazil in the first place.

I’m thankful for having a purpose now - for being able to know that if I want to dig deep there are always a pile worthwhile tasks waiting to be done to push the project forward.

A good day today inching everything forward. Great lesson with Nathan teaching him how to read properly. I wish I had done it like this from the start.

First staff meeting today. Put Wesley in the equipe técnica group and invited him to the meetings.

More importantly, committed to the house in engenho do mato! Sorted the (fast) internet and looks like Maria Izabel will be able to help us with a bunch of household stuff now as well.

Thinking of going there Tuesday to Friday every week that you can. 

2021

They took Dad to the old folks home then took him back to the hospital. Just found out he had a generalized epileptic seizure (which can be associated with very low
sodium). He was twitching with me and Mum in the morning, having difficulty moving and could hardly speak. We should have said something to
staff there and then.

Anyway let’s hope that they treat him as a bit more of a priority now.

A lot of admin to get through today with favela brass but got at it.

2021

Had 3 craft beers tonight, and have to say I’m not regretting it. Left the iPhone upstairs and alternated playing Schumann and watching The Crown and Borgen. Bliss. No booze during the week and no caffeine at the weekend would be a great rule if you could stick to it.

Odara is progressing well. Better to go for a great arrangement every week rather than trying to knock more out and ending up with dozens of arrangements and no arrangements.

When COVID is over you need to have the parties, you need to go out and play and do Carnival properly. You need to have your week but you also need to have your weekend. You lost a decade 18-28, and even the first few years in Rio you weren’t dating. We’re not talking going out and getting drunk or even sitting on the beach, we’re talking bringing people together for great music and great times. And catching up a bit on those lost years.

Holidays at home in Engenho do Mato. Still got a lot of stuff to sort out though - doesn’t feel much like you’re letting go and letting your mind go on to other stuff. You’re sorting instrument purchases, dealing with show proposals, and still have the Rouanet project hanging over your head. Also came down with pharyngitis and on antibiotics which put a bit of a damper on it - watched England go out to Spain in the final of the Euros without beer, for example.

Today set up bank account for Brassify Produções and did a quote for show and wrote release for Amigos da Cacilda. Decided to get professional about this - logo, t-shirts, instagram, decent demo video etc. etc. Need to put this stuff first.

Went to the cinema and watched Inside Out 2 at the multicenter in Itaipu. Put you in touch with your nobler impulses - great when films do that. When you did the right thing with Favela Brass at the start, it genuinely was out of this kind of instinct. Congratulations, you’re a cheesy do-gooder.

Enjoying cooking at the moment, especially barbecue (watching the barbecue showdown series), but also chef jean-pierce an Youtube is great and cajun food is a bit of a revelation. Debating whether to get a Weber grill. Lovely to be enjoying all this great food with Thamires - just need to get more exercise into the routine to balance things out a bit…

Museum of arts et metiere in the morning. Mum thought it was about the arts and crafts movement but actually was more about the history science and technology but was interesting nevertheless. Inspired by the scale models they created as part of the design process - so much detail, so much thought. 

Head in the clouds a bit thinking about a name for a site that you could put your arrangements on: art of brass, street brass arrangements, funky street brass etc. Mum talking about the arts and crafts movement was interesting - definitely a parallel there.

Lovely lunch at Derrière, very quick trip to small modern art gallery, then later on cocktails in the heat and the gruesome walking tour with Victoria. Really enjoyed the walking tour.

Another day of admin, lessons and quesadillas this time with a board meeting at the end. Mirela refusing to share documents before the meeting and didn’t make a proper agenda. Also I specifically asked her to put rouanet earlier in the meeting because of its importance but she left it to last. What does that tell you?

More random ideas from Lucca and Bindu but we’re inching forward towards a proper strategic planning session. Hopefully once cash starts coming in they will start getting serious about Rouanet. Those first sales are crucial (but the corporate ones only come at the end of the year, remember).

Loving breakfasts at Bagdad café with the cute waitresses.

So back to the question: what would save live music? What saved it in Rio - street music, carnival, dressing up, debauchery. And a music tradition to hang it on. How can that be spread to other places?

What are the catalysts? Having cool repertoire there for adult and youth bands to play. Having people who have been to Rio Carnival and want to bring it back to their own city. Having blocos and brass bands in youth education programs. Permission to play in the street.

2025

Reading *Brandraising 2.0 *and thinking about both your story and the story of Favela Brass. Ideally there would be a villain. Who/what is that? Certainly for you one answer is the rise of bland, electronic music (muzak) over live music and the unintended war against mastery waged by our electronic devices. The decline of popular music.

You found Brazilian music and thought it could be the live music to make that fightback, then you went there and it turned out to be the Brazilian spirit, Carnaval, brass bands, blocos, that has the power to defeat that enemy. Nothing compares to Carnaval.

The French music methods reinforce this war against dumbing down / attempt to reclaim mastery. Your piano practice is this. You’re trying to connect the kids to this old way of doing things. Also, the whole aim of getting 8 at grade 8 is a mastery goal.

One of the difficult things for you is that you don’t have much time for arranging - in a different time, you could dedicate yourself to it it, but now it’s something that you just about squeeze into a spare hour before work. You actually really want to be doing this kind of deep work, but you have the day job of running Favela Brass. 

Dick Hawdon, Eddie Harvey, Maestro Nelsinho, these were your guides.

But how does that villain manifest itself as on ongoing threatening presence during the film? Could the villain also be the logistical - the difficulty and cost of live music?

Taking it back to Star Wars, the enemy is the “Evil Empire”, with the Empire in some way representing the kind of faceless industrialization, in contrast to the Jedi’s more artisan abilities, notably the ability to use the force, and a light-saber. Is the evil empire Spotify, Taylor Swift, and Mark Zuckerberg - are these the forces of musical stagnation? Is it us vs the cellphone? 

The empire uses blasters, whereas the Jedi use light sabres. Music nowadays is made with software and plugins and recreated via JBLs, whereas our students are using real instruments.

Star Wars is a great way to frame the street brass band movement - a rebel alliance against crap electronic musak, and for music in the streets. 

2023

Great first rehearsal with Dan and Wesley. Really enjoyed the band being able to play without me. Also the collective impro lesson at the start went great - there’s a lot of momentum now. Stressed during the day though with all the admin crap - got to get this offloaded onto Pam and the team. Got to get out of the way.

2024

Got the keys to the new house yesterday. Wasn’t quite the day that we were anticipating. Phone bricked (bye bye R$1.600), ended up finding another R$6.000 worth of extra costs and by the time we got back to the house it was already dark. Ended up with you and Thamires bickering later on.

The house needs a lot of work, no two ways about that. And it needs work to be suitable for toddlers. It’s going to be expensive to put right a bunch of blunders on the previous owner’s part. It’s on the borderline between being easier to start from scratch. But it’s big, it’s exactly where you want to live and it has potential. It’s almost like you have to doublethink yourself that it was a house that you were given. Now make the most of it.

Thinking that in terms of the Favela Brass/arranging dilemma, the best thing may just be to go all in with the Anthony Trollope routine: 5:30 - 8:30 Monday to Friday with the first half of that being writing and the second half recording. Make that the big rock that the rest of the day is arranged around. Trollope wrote more than anyone else with that time, and you need to keep this away from weekends.

2022

Long, productive day. Printed essential elements for recorder for the first time. Looking forward to getting stuck into that. Meditated, cup of tea, piano, trumpet practice - all that good stuff. Meeting at lunch with Igor and Norton’s other friends at the prefeitura. Showed Joe how to do the Miyagi thing so that should be a load off.

In really good spirits in contrast with yesterday. Might be difficult to sleep. Just used to a cup of tea in the morning.

I’m grateful for essential elements
I’m grateful for my staff
I’m grateful for my new laser printer!

2021

Antonio and his sons blitzed the house today. Genuinely impressive - roof sorted, housing built for water tanks (just need to put roof on tomorrow). Not overcharging either (or at least doesn’t seem like it to me). Nice to see the house coming along - regivaldo is tidying things up nicely and rendering walls etc. Let’s get this place ready for Airbnb and make this cash back.

Escaped to Norton’s and we had a great chat about the project - very happy to have him on the board. Bit stressed getting the materials ready for the assembleia geral on Wednesday on top of these guri videos, building work etc. but we’ll get there.

Great sax lesson with Gabi just teaching here to play cai cai balão and when the saints in G and F + arpeggios and scales. Already she was starting to find things by ear. Practical musicianship - this really is a great way to teach.

I am grateful for my downstairs main bedroom with its quiet and cosy feel. I’m grateful for having a decent builder to call in Antonio.

I’m grateful for having landed on the practical musicianship thing. So many dead ends and red herrings but this is actually good. If they leave being able to take a bunch of tunes round the keys and sight read then just that will take them a long way.

Back home with Thiago (“Jim”?). After all the stories about how difficult it is with a newborn and how much of a strain it puts on the relationship, so far it’s been remarkably tranquilo. Obviously more waking up during the night, but then you were already used to that with Zola. Let’s see how long it lasts!

Thinking quite a bit about the possibility of suing the hospital for the failures during the run up to birth - not enough doctors, no ultrasound, no anaesthesia, and certainly no apology. One problem is Phillip having helped you and Thamires.

New house is a dream, the view of endless trees from the bedroom amazing.

Still with this idea of the Taça das Fanfarras.

2023

Went to Florianopolis with Mum and Thamires and got off caffeine. Falling for Thamires as well. Just love spending time with her - great humour, great food connection, no moodiness, totally grounded. Only thing is how long you’d have to wait to get her up the duff, and the small matter of her not wanting kids any time soon. That’s the tricky part.

Then there was Paraty which was fantastic - Favela Brass finally having the organization to pull off a trip properly, thanks mainly to Vivi. Dan, Marquinho and Bolinho doing a good job as monitors and the kids are sounding great. Bit of a shaky moment giving the talk in the cultural center but all good.

Being off caffeine is an eye-opener - it definitely makes life more enjoyable, and you a nicer, funnier person. Energy levels higher through the day, and it’s great to feel that when you’re tired you can actually rest and recuperate.

All I can think about now is getting out of the Favela Brass admin. Handing over ED to Pam and focusing on the music. Making a studio out of the other side of your room and getting at these arrangements - I mean really getting at them, Quincy Jones style. What if you actually did it properly, with a decent set up so the videos were properly professional?

3 months takes you to the start of June. What should you be doing in that time? Getting the Rouanet project the way you want it through 2024, in general making changes that you won’t be able to make once you’re out of the ED chair. Getting the board part of it running smoothly. Enshrining the little book of boards.

Or another way of looking at it: today was a day when you didn’t write any music. Could you make it the last one?

2021

Look at how the regularity of the diary has increased since you read the art of impossible. Stick to this checklist. 

Cycled up to paineiras today although kept having to scrounge pumps off people because of a slow puncture. Did a good morning putting together trumpet folhas. This method book is going to be an amazing tool. Just keep plugging away.

I am grateful for the internet - the way that I can find things like partimento and have a whole book about it on the computer instantly. All that incredible information from across the world and the centuries all there in some form or other. You meed never be bored intellectually for the rest of your life

I’m grateful for the micos that eat the bananas off my sky dish, and for the fans in my room.

What Dad had yesterday turned out to be a severe stroke. His right arm is paralyzed and he can’t talk. Went back to the hospital on my own tonight and before I left, said goodbye and told him I loved him. He squeezed my hand.

Sitting with him I just kept thinking what does it mean? Not just for my life, but what is it you are glimpsing here? With the poems he was reciting from memory, with the feelings of the importance of family. Is it something to do with what is important in life?

The piano is figuring more and more for you. Memorizing pieces is a bit like the poems.

I did think that this might be the moment to leave the favela. If you think about what he would have wanted, he would have wanted me safe and starting the family band with a beautiful black Brazilian girl. Can you make that happen in time?

Made you want to meditate and no caffeine as well. To be present. To keep closer to humanity.

But there you go again. All about you and what you’re going to do. This is why the meditation is important

Decided it’s time to sack Rafael. The next hire became clear (development/marketing director), and it also became clear that in Rafael you didn’t have someone you could delegate communications to.

Did first parrilla on Saturday. Joe, Raissa, Camilla, Laura, Tiele, plus Frenchies Rafael and Noe. Long way to go food-wise but really enjoyed it - this is your favorite way to socialize, this is your hobby. Drank way too much, but didn’t make any gaffes at least. Put back out carrying the veg up.

Cris has well and truly put herself between you and the kids. There’s the Rafael thing but also Bolinho and Marquinho speak to her instead of you. There’s a campaign going here - get between you and the students, parents and partners. You’ve got your work cut out because it’s Cris, Raissa and Camila together against you and they have shit on you.

Raissa at the barbecue really exposed herself when we were talking about Hedi’s situation with the neighbor - she said we should spy on Max to find his weak points etc. Also how Marquinho must be a bandido to be able to park his car up up and how Kelly from the associação ended up saying to her “just don’t say anything to anyone”.

This is going to be a tricky game of snooker.

2021

Beers with Stugger, Potts and Biglad yesterday at the sal. Managed to slow it down enough not to have a massive hangover today, about 4 ½ pints.

His leaving dyja was to do with the spat with their secretary, Brenda. Difficult to know exactly what happened but it does seem like people with be breathing a sigh of relief with Stugger’s departure.

He asked if we could make his project in the schools “Favela Brass UK” and you said no straight up. Good lad. He was talking about giving a percentage of profits to Favela Brass Brazil. Thinking about it now that would mean him raising money and instruments and getting paid using the Favela Brass name and just a whole load of mess.

The problem is still their though as he could easily latch on to Friends of Favela Brass. Time for a little chat with Mum…

Traveling back to Rio. Enjoying the journey listening to Paris, city of dreams, thinking about method stuff, planning, drinking wine and, yes, a cheeky coffee as well. Life is good.

Can’t help thinking about brass band music outside of Rio. Grandiose thoughts of helping groups all over the world bring people together in the streets - the whole live music vs Dj thing. You want to keep your feet on the ground but you also want to stretch in terms of impact.

What are you good at and what would have the most impact?

You’re good at writing arrangements, organizing learning materials and rehearsing bands - and playing all the instruments. Not so good as a long-term manager of people/relationships and also not got the killer business touch. 

Impact-wise it would be a bunch of music schools / bands all over the world copying Favela Brass, playing your arrangements basically. Maybe not setting up schools from scratch, but doing shorter courses at different places - running from couple of weeks to a term. Working with groups who already play a bit (remember that your strong point isn’t the beginner lessons - it’s the arrangements, the grooves, the impro teaching method.)

You want to get the movement for brass (and blocos) in the streets going. But on the musical side.

What is it that you have or do that is actually going to make such a difference?

Jazz band at Hedi’s going really well. Thinking about maybe buying some of the those Hal Leonard arrangements and starting to involve Vini and Ryan. Maybe do a monthly show near Itaipu? @jazzdotom?

Working on the « Medley dos Amigos » which I think is going to work a treat - musically, and for publicity. Coming to the conclusion that I should do 1-3 pomodoros of arranging (and only arranging) every day, striving for 3 on a normal day. Point is that there’s a minimum.

Washed the Kanstul (finally) and the valves work great now. You’re getting back into the trumpet. How would life have been different if you met your wife at 17 and not your trumpet? Have you met your wife now?

Also put together the bedside table for downstairs. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Working on an Airbnb house with Thamires would be so nice. Interest rates won’t stay at 13% forever.

Went over the top again yesterday, this time went down via Vista Chinesa, Lagoa, Copacabana. Resolved to wrap up work-wise by 15:30 which meant that it wasn’t dark till I got to Copa - if I hadn’t had brake problems (luckily dropped on that bike shop/bar) I could have got further in the light. Back up at 19:40 so the whole thing must have lasted about 3 hours. Walked up Benjamin constant but rode the rest. Piano (Bach II original key) and trumpet practice (Bimbini duets) no problem on return.

At a particularly picturesque point, with the blood pumping through the legs, coming down towards the vista chinesa I had a bit of an epiphany: Rio is incredibly beautiful and you HAVE TO GET OUT IN THIS. The cycling is a very good start but you need to get out to the sea as well - a rowing club would be great, could also get down to the beach for volleyball, swim in the sea etc. After a jittery, cranky week, something like this really sorts you out.

When it’s 3 hours and with a good audio book (in this case “a world without email” by Cal Newport) you really zone in and move on from the daily troubles. Flow. This is so important - remember Andy Casterton and the cup of water? If you’re getting up at 5 (like today), you should be able to wrap up by 3:30, and if you haven’t got lessons or a meeting, getting out in nature and exercising is just the ticket.

Actually thought about trying a 3-hour batch of piano today to see how that goes - maybe longer stretches will get you into a deeper flow. But I think masses of exercise is the one for sorting your head out. You’re a border collie.

Caffeine-induced fail yesterday. After receiving the great news that Prio are going to fund our Rouanet had a really bad board meeting.

First up you should have been more on top of the documentation for FOCA and second up you should have been honest and open with them about the fact that one of the comprovantes won’t be ready in time.

On top of that you didn’t give much thought to the debate about whether to dispense with FOCA or not

Been stressed about this first picnic event Sunday. Out for the count with a fever earlier in the week. This is a part of the project that would be fantastic to get delegated. Produtora. Michelle? Glaucya?

Finished first version of Batukarate book.

Far too long since I did a full diary. Charlo, Paulo, Emily, Tara and Candy from Honk! (Somerville) were here for Honk! Rio this weekend and brought loads of stuff for us - Roland Cube, 4 tpts, 2 trombones, 2 clarinets, euph. Definitely great contacts for us going forward.

Friday turma 2 played Honk! At Praça Odila Costa and was a big success, despite the rain. Then yesterday turma 1 played at Talho Capixaba in Leblon and raised R$800 with 2 x 30 minute sets. Leblon is definitely the place!

New Mac mini arrived but problems with Wifi and not having the same connections as the old one. Printer still not arrived at the Loja Americanas store. Very frustrating to be losing so much time with tech problems.

Honk! Rio just reinforced the mission that Rio is a massive opportunity for live street music and that poorer kids have to be preparing to get involved in this. What you are doing is going to turbocharge this whole fanfarra/bloco scene. Imagine the difference that 24 grade 8 students, plus a repertoire of top arrangements is going to make in terms of the quality factor.

With summer approaching and the pool clean took a dip at the end of the day and yes you definitely get used to this! Rafael our friendly gardener did the predictable and hacked all the branches off the trees at the bottom of the garden rather than pruning them. But it’s nice to have the garden more under control. 

Woke up in the middle of the night last night with worries about the Favela Brass budget for next year. Really want to write a Brassify project for Rouanet next year but I don’t think I’ll end up having time.

I am grateful for the feeling of playing with the metronome, I’m grateful for the bike repair shop that keeps me on the road. I’m grateful for having cheap fruit and veg delivered to my door.

The fruit and veg thing is amazing because for very little cash you can get a great variety of healthy food to get you through the week. Lots of people don’t have access to a healthy balanced diet, here you don’t even need to go as far as the shops. All those amazing cooking possibilities.

I’m heavy into this playing card system for practicing piano. Works a treat for motivation but I pulled both jokers tonight which meant 2 beers on a school night. Still, like the idea of sticking to the system.

PetroRio asked us to come to their offices on Tuesday September 13 for a tour and to do a show. Means taking the kids out of school for the afternoon. Cris put the invite in the group and various parents got back saying they won’t take their kids out of school for this.

Chatting with Cris you showed how annoyed you were about this. How you think the parents aren’t loyal, and how you will make sure that by “pura coincidência” there will be more opportunities for the kids of parents that helped us with this.

Loose talk. Cris didn’t emphasize any benefit for them in the invite (the fact that the kids will get a tour and learn about employment in petroleum), or make clear enough how important it is. Parents not wanting to take the kids out of school is not a totally unreasonable stance.

You just gave Cris some great ammo to turn parents against you. You’re making yourself an easy target.

Dad came around a bit today. Was trying to say something at one point. While you lay in your comfy bed thinking about the future, he’s trapped in there. What does he want from us at this point? Played Louis Armstrong to him tonight.

He had a blood clot stroke before it hemorrhaged. That means it could have been caught early. Why didn’t I think to be looking out for stroke symptoms? Hospital has killed Dad I think. Fair enough COVID has overstretched them but they never gave him the attention he needed. Nobody got hold of his case. 

*What does it mean? Part of what it means is the cliche - value life for every drop. Every last fucking drop. Every last second, every last word, every last note. Make it count, make it all count. Play it like you mean it*

Stepped the piano practice up to 45 mins today. Stepping it up to an hour tomorrow. Watching Elton John film today and suddenly found that I could comprehend even the more complex chord changes. When it cut to a shot of the fingers on the piano keyboard I saw that I had it in the right key as well. This is working: play it, learn it, own it, repeat.

Rubbish night’s sleep last night - first the mouse woke me up at 2am, then thinking about the Stugger/Carola thing kept me awake. Ended up sleeping in till 8:30am which is completely unheard of for me. Decided to just focus on one thing again and hit the FB curriculum website. Not an amazing day, but did get quite a bit done. Thinking that it may even be best just to alternate days between admin and whatever the next learning materials task is - to concentrate on finishing things, that is.

Feeling fine and enjoying my one craft beer each day - makes responding emails easier I find!  Thinking seriously about getting this LA olds ambassador done up - it plays like an absolute dream. Trumpet chops are coming back in let’s try and keep this up.

The usual elements of the board are opposed to forwarding money from the main account to tide us over until we receive the cash from PRIO at the end of March. Had to listen to two hours of wisdom on the subject from Sômulo and Mirela last night. They want to drive the project off a cliff for fear of running out of petrol. 

You have been reacting too much recently. Saying too much. Not holding back. Not just at work but at home too. You’re not sleeping well and when you have a baby this will only get worse. You need a strategy to deal with this. To keep this stuff in you need to adopt a default silent front, a mask.

You did this in the meeting last night and it worked well. Just let them talk and talk and then make your point succinctly.

So it’s some kind of vow of silence - not a heavy, cold, un-smiling silence, but a definite and sustained commitment to holding things in. This has always been a problem for you. You need to be a bit more the Oracle at Delphi and a bit less Frank Spencer!

Offered a job at the British School Barra by Zezo yesterday and tried to pass it to Stugger but he didn’t want it.

Liking this idea of a sabbatical in 2024 so long as it doesn’t destroy your savings. Year in Kampala? Montreal? Paris? Donny?!?

It’s a nice time this, hitting the big band arrangements in the morning, lots of nice food, tea and wine and watching good tv with the folks. By the end of Monday should have 3-4 recorded. Thinking about doing a lockdown video of me playing all instruments on Blinding Lights. Bit show offy but also a good bit of self promotion and will get people thinking about the band.

Joe Hewitt has been in touch about this possible grant from a cosmetics firm. Taking into account what he said I pitched the idea of trying to break the Guiness work record for the biggest ever melódica group at the end of next year. Current record is 688.

Main stumbling point is the price of the instruments but wouldn’t it be cool? 

Disadvantages:

If someone gave you £10k you wouldn’t buy 700 melódicas. It’s a very expensive publicity stunt.

You’ll have to do massive melódica classes at each school - will this work?

Joe wants his project to manage this project which could be a little tricky.

You don’t need 700 kids in the feeder program - you need 150. How are all these kids going to graduate on to horns?

If we involve private schools that could suck a lot of time and energy out of things like getting a big band ready for 2022.

Advantages:

Gives us a focus for 2021 and a success (hopefully) at the end of it.

It’s an easy thing to sell as a fundraising target (buy the instruments)

Schools will love being able to involve more kids

Possibly give us a nice little project to do with the private schools.

We will never need to buy melódicas again.

If Mangueirinha isn’t doing perc in the schools, we already need more melódicas / recorders.

Would get loads of media attention and lead on to other things. You could even do a Rouanet project just for this - 200.000k with most of that going on melódicas.

Could start partnership with hohner or Yamaha 

You’re entering into the mass arena which is really what Rio needs. Gives you and the project a higher profile.

It’s a story it’s a story it’s a story.

End of year show at CIEP. The classic of classics of you stressing like crazy the night before and then it going ok. You couldn’t sleep, thinking about all the things that needed to be sorted, the board, Diane and Angelo, the logistics. Would have been good to make a diary of all that.

Having moved the event to CIEP because of possible rain of course on the day we got blazing sunshine. But I think CIEP was better - somewhere different for the end of year event. Putting the kids on the banked seating worked, and Camila’s video turned out an absolute peach.

Diane clearly loved it and now wants us to play on an oil rig! 🤷‍♂️ Need to thank Angelo properly. Do you remember Sômulo reading through your set list and notes? Nutter. Next time just print out the lyrics to “tristeza” and leave it on the stand. And then Bindu ringing up the next day to “debrief” you and try and micromanage the communications 🤮.

Show at PRIO yesterday, pretty sure I forgot Nelson’s name. Gradually working out how we’re going to divide the work at favela brass with the roles of new people etc. Really wanting to let Camila go and get someone vaguely professional in.

Candidates are great, but asking for more money than we have.

2 hours of piano practice first thing. Favela Brass admin stuff through the day - trying to get the Trello boards sorted and organize the next few weeks. Good chat to Ed about Rouanet delay and finally chatted to Bill and Amit about the fun run.

Decided to give us a week off in terms of the lessons in the favela (school is also out). Tayenne was supposed to come but didn’t. Ended up doing barbecue for 1 which was actually quite cool. Chicken thighs with sardines (will leave out the sardines next time), sweet potatoes with sugary pecan sauce (not as mind blowing as I thought it would be) and banana and strawberry with chocolate sauce (sauce needs to be more special). BBQ is a great hobby.

Later on took the window out in the practice room and put a layer of drywall in both window cavities. Seriously thinking about going for it and putting a layer of drywall on at least the front-facing wall.

Yesterday Dad took a turn for the worse in the heat. Very weak and then very confused later on. We got the doctor out and they will adjust his medication but it’s an awful time for him. Just doesn’t bear thinking about what must be going through his mind. Also worrying in terms of how Mum is going to be able to care for him after I have gone back.

Breakfast with Geoffrey at Cafe Bagdad - another one that you were a bit worried about but went great. Played a bit with the local singer/guitarists, great food (enchilada de mole, churros etc.) Geoffrey also agreed to do the rouanet thing and share it with his office. This rouanet pessoas físicas thing is going to work.

Just been to the more rootsy kind of area near the hotel and had some of those Mexican beers in a cup with lime and salt, sweet tamarind paste and sesame seeds round the lip of the cup and spicy cherries on a stick. Followed by fried plantains with condensed milk and strawberry jam. All very nice indeed but gut-rot city!

You’re obsessed. Can you not just chill out for once and not think about your plans for world brass band dominance?

Mixing up the emotions listening to 90s music. Stuff that was cool at the time.

Whenever you drink, you think: stay the fuck in Rio. Be loyal. Ok whatever do consultancy, make your online materials, great, but Brazil is genuinely cool. Yes you can get out of the hard stuff at favela brass and concentrate on the music, but Rio is the future of live music.

Out with Thamires to Panka and watch Funkenstein near Beco Do Rato. Was a bit under the weather but great night - another cracking session of drunk sex with Thamires, listening the MPB 80 playlist. Today finished the arrangement of « Say it right » by Nelly Furtado although I’m not quite getting the finished feeling. With this one best to get it out there while the song is still hot.

After far too much deliberation I bought the JBL bookshelf speakers. Cheap, well reviewed, and go with your existing kit. Get some hi-fi back in your life.

On tenterhooks about Wesley’s refund of R$15k which didn’t go through. Still thinking about the Fundação Darcy Ribeiro - it’s loads of cash but you’d be set for life, and out of the favela. Loads of tricky FB admin and decisions this week.

Yesterday morning (Sunday) asked Claude to help you find Belle Epoque piano pieces, but it wasn’t the same as with French cooking - at the end of the day you pretty much decided to keep on with Grieg’s Lyric Pieces. However, did Cécile Chaminade in the process. The Lyric Pieces are already a good selection of moods and are of a certain length which makes them good for the transposition work you’re doing. Just keep ploughing through and when you get to the next book listen through on Spotify and see if there are any duff tunes and skip them. Put up shelving in the kitchen and pantry later on.

Amigos da Cacilda did their first gig in the street without me yesterday at the feira da Glória - brilliant! This automation thing isn’t just about AI…

Talking about AI it’s tricky because much as you want to delegate to staff, the best person to talk to AI is generally you.

Pam very stroppy in meeting yesterday about 10 years celebrations with Vivi, when I suggest that the Cristo action could be our main event that happens whatever. The question is: is she the kind of person that is going to lead Favela Brass to victory, or make everyone’s life (including the board and partners) a misery. Feels like you have given away your power and to take it back is difficult. But you still haven’t given away your DE position. Bindu suggests staying as DE and delegating the musical director part: will mull that over…

Jazz fest in Gávea with Turma 1, BCS Fun Run in Lagoa with Turma 2. Ivan lets you know that we can’t leave any kit downstairs in the Assuncao any more. Where would we rehearse if we lost the assunção?

Finally the first run where nobody came. Zero. Not at all surprising. 

To Hedi’s after for a calzone and a G + T and Cris sends a bunch of messages about how honk was a mistake, how Sylvio is a bad example for the kids and how the baile brass is an adult event and the kids will go home after their show. 

It’s true that we have to avoid putting kids in adult situations and Sylvio definitely is not the best role model for them. But they need to be buzzed about the project. If not Baile Brass and Honk, then what? How do get the energy without the booze and pot smoking going on?

Cris being an anti-Carnaval, evangelical (probably) bolsonarista also makes for a complicated dynamic. Sylvio and Honk must be the antichrist for her. Got to look for the middle ground.

Talked to Hedi about doing a curry clube there and he likes the idea. I think it could work. A regular blow in the favela and finally a chance to play jazz trumpet would be great. I think we might get a decent turn out.

The whole FOCA thing with the board is pissing me off. Norton has a key vote and Bindu is talking to him out of the group. Bulldozer. 

Camila didn’t turn up today to film, didn’t let me know so day wasn’t recorded properly with new iPhone etc. For want of a better word I can’t help feeling that Camila is a bit of a c*w. Need a communication/marketing person above her.

Livia situation. She’s a whirlwind so it made sense to transfer the kids back to the aterro when the opportunity presented, but there were failures of intelligence and communication. Cris taking fofocas from the favela at face value and probably saying too much to Carol. 

Carol went to Kelly from the residents association and you had a meeting. Overall positive because Kelly at least says that she’s with you. She also delivered a list of the Mums that are out to get you, spreading rumours that you are stealing money to try and arrange a problem with you in the favela, and working towards legal action.

A light bulb came on yesterday: working in the favelas will be more of the same, and will limit the project. Why don’t you go the schools route? Even if the kids don’t all go to the aterro Saturdays. The Doncaster Youth Jazz part of this is up and running, now is the time to get the local authority music service on its feet.

In the rhythm of 25-30 mins piano in the morning (with coffee). It is so enjoyable and with the element of zero tolerance of errors becomes an exercise in concentration. At the king’s coronation a calligrapher was tasked did the lettering on the record by hand without mistakes. This is the kind of human feat that you admire and it feels great to walk the tightrope of playing a tune in a different key by memory and get to the end without mistakes. It’s time out of the day, but it gets you out of bed, it gets you concentrating, it expands you musically and most all you enjoy it intensely. This is your ritual, your times crossword.

2020

Missed the diary yesterday this really does need to be done first thing. Also missed the piano - should also be first thing.

Been working on this Natura grant with Carola and, surprisingly, it hasn’t been ideal. She wrote some parts well but in other parts missed the main important points to get in, and at other points downright sloppy. The real problem is when you try to get her to change stuff she digs her heels in, or does things like just copying in the bullet points of the points I sent, rather than putting them in text. Very long, impenetrable paragraphs. Ended up telling her that me and Joe would do the last revision. Joe wants to do our grant-writing and has done a revision already. If he’s good at it, I don’t have a problem with that. 

Finally got the meeting with the accountant, Sr. Milton. Went fine and cleared up most stuff. We’re better off with a UK account otherwise it’s complicated to spend pounds. Angelo didn’t set up the board meeting, even after the chat.

Spending quite a lot of time on the Favela Brass Keynote presentation. This stuff is important.

Quite lethargic at this moment. Been dialing caffeine, booze and food back so not overly surprised. Didn’t quite get as stuck into the finances I would like today, but the arranging is going well. Looking back at past diaries I can’t help wondering how much better off I would be if, instead of going round in circles thinking about MLT, I had just worked on arranging for the 1st 90 mins of the working day.

2019

I now have a working computer, printer and internet connection. Life is good. Hopefully now I’ll be able to get on top of things. At the moment the focus is not on the curriculum so much as the organisation of the project - produção. The general idea is to set things up so you have systems and checklists on Google drive that other people can use.

This is especially important because your memory is not the greatest. Get it all down on paper/spreadsheets. Do the role, set up a system and pass it on.

Ind the end, what do you want to be doing? I think overseeing the system is the way forward. Giving some lessons to test materials, and being an ambassador for the project. The position of Executive Director makes sense because that allows you to get paid.

Ideally, you would be executive director, then hand that off to someone else (Joe?) and be president of the board. Then hand that off as well and do something else but stay as advisor, maybe volunteer Musical Director (or paid musical director!) Maybe longer term looking at wider music service in Rio

[2020 comment - the idea of becoming a volunteer Musical Director in the end shows how you need to look out for yourself more. Obviously after all this if you’re still working for Favela Brass you, above all people, should be getting paid]

2022

Alice’s birthday. Didn’t get her a pressy but bought Amazon voucher. Did the cake and happy birthday over Zoom. Printed out the John MacAllister warm-ups - you don’t have to do this all yourself. 

Spending the afternoon drinking a very nice bottle of Portuguese wine and listening to music. Have to say this is one of my favorite things to do. Spotify is great now with the radio option.

Certain tracks take you straight back to your teens. With that come strong saudades for Dad. At least now the end is a bit less prevalent and you can focus more on just missing him. Dreamt quite vividly last night that he was still alive, not for the first time. Was a pleasant dream though. 

Read somewhere about someone making a death bed promise to their father. Don’t forget that you did this. The band of brown grandkids. Do it for dad, and Mum, do it for them, and your future wife, and for yourself. Don’t sleep on this. You made a promise.

What you really want is to listen to and make great music with friends. Why not do a curry every so often? Much better than what you were doing taking hotel rooms alone. When you have leisure time you yearn to be with other people. That’s curry clube and this thing in Lapa.

Mate, you’re 42, live a little. Find a recorder teacher for the schools. Favela brass is better with you bringing the network together and doing the music part. Get your amp back, do a curry and then work out how to get other people involved. I reckon Friday is good. Don’t worry about a band straight off.

If we’re talking about spirituality and all that crap, having a drink and listening to great music with friends is absolutely fundamental for you. Once a week. You’ve been struggling with this leisure thing for a bit. Invite people over for a curry, have a jam at cozinha da Lapa and you’re good.

Later…

The thing about Dad was that he was solid. He held his own. He didn’t fawn, didn’t lose his dignity. Ever. Witty, sharp. Never played the fool. He was a proper father with strong limits. You are your own man, but don’t give yourself away. Hold your end up, hold the family end up. Find a way to honour your Dad. 

Really, when you think about it, Dad’s funeral was a testament to your pettiness. You should have given him the New Orleans burial. You just didn’t want to get Stugger involved. Fool.

Ah, and don’t forget to do this. Have a drink, put the headphones on and listen to great music. This is your holiday.
This is how to put it all in perspective.

When you drink you think: drop it. Get back in touch with Stugger, with the boys, get together for a beer and listen to some music. Drop it with Fernando Pereira. Go to Stugger’s wedding. Be loyal. Drop it with Marcia, Somulo, Bindu. Fucking DROP IT! Live and let live. Chill the fuck out!

I don’t know what the hangover will be like tomorrow but I think this is worth it. Connect with yourself, with what’s important. Music.

Still liking this idea of the 3-department model. Money in, money out, results. Means that you don’t have to hire an integrator now - it’s the development director, who could possibly then step up to integrator. Part of that development director budget could come from sacking Rafael. I mean, you could promote him to development director as well but just don’t think he’s smart enough.

Started reading my first parenting book, “Brain Rules for Baby”, which makes clear the strain that goes on the relationship between the parents in the first year and the importance of that relationship for the baby’s development.

To be fair though there really hasn’t been time to relax. Still hasn’t stopped

Did percussion study 1 video this morning which I thought was pretty useful. Fernando Pereira talking about doing W Clement Stone Quartets which would be cool. Just need to rest the brain a bit to work o it how it could all fit together.

Yesterday launched tubemapscales.com - got few comments and nice feedback in the UK teachers group. One person donated £3 and asked for Sax Grade 4. If I’m only getting paid to do new ones and the going rate is £3 this isn’t going to make me rich! However, 75 people visiting the site yesterday is not bad. I reckon do a new one every week and this could be a good slow-burner (and who knows maybe even bring a little bit of spare income).

Went for a long cycle ride today down the other side and back up again via Gloria. Thought a lot about the idea of pushing it every day - that’s what is fun/satisfying. Had the idea of focusing on one thing each day first thing brassify/method/admin. Anyway.

Listened to podcast about Groundhog Day and then watched the film, which really resonated. A lot to think about right there, about treating people right, practicing, and making the most of the day. Straight after had a nice conversation with Joe and then brought back down to earth by the terrible conversations in the Favela Brass WhatsApp group. I just don’t get the feeling I can trust Cris either. Seriously looking at the door with Favela Brass.

Anyway. Hold the happy thoughts from today a bit. Head down to Santa, have a toot on the euphonium and a whisky and get up tomorrow and do it all again!

Frustrating board meeting last night as Sômulo now wants to do this year’s event on a big scale at Circo Voador, hang the expense. What made Circo Voador a nightmare (and makes a closed event at Democráticos a more appealing option) was Sômulo losing the plot as the event approached.

Carnaval is in full swing.

Saturday was céu Na Terra, which made you think that you should teach the kids exactly their repertoire, for them to be able to fit straight in when they are older (there are videos of their repertoire as well). Took that Leny girl back but seems like a whole load of stress. Went back into the thick of it and did a cool impromptu bloco down to Lapa.

Sunday was Boitolo, which predictably was fun up to Gloria. Then hit Besame mucho, let Danish Airbnb couple Karl and ???? into the house then headed to os siderais and ensuing cortejo. Again, great fun. Got taxi back to Laranjeiras with two beautiful black girls and invited them to terra de ninguém but neglected to get Amanda’s contact. Doh!

Monday Terra de Ninguém. Beautiful - if a bit sunny. Remember that dickhead British couple with the Union Jack outfits? Do everything you can not to be like that, and remember that if you move back to Britain, that’s who you’ll be moving back to.

Ended up walking back into Rio with a trumpeter, Felipe, that apparently you already knew (doh!) and two girls: one that I think stalked you at the cacilda times and another sweet, but too young, flute player. 

Got back home in the afternoon and started coming down with something: hopefully just a cold. Actually remarkably not hung-over considering the amounts you have been drinking (1 drink on each hour is a good workable rule for Carnaval).

Carnaval got me thinking:

1. kitfanfarra.com with links to arrangeme.com would be a great contribution. Brazilians will pirate it all anyway, but it won’t be your fault. Think of all the clips with 
. Could do flexible instrumentation (voice 1 = Tpt/Alto/sop etc.) - remember the problem with brassify is who will play the charts?
2. If you’re in the live music experience business there is nowhere on earth like this. Don’t carp on about how cariocas are untrustworthy/unprofessional - just think about how perfect this place is for brass band music. Best audiences ever.
3. Getting (good) foreign brass bands here would be a worthy mission: do a sponsored festival to get them paid, then let them loose in the streets like NYBB.
4. Having your own brass band would be amazing. Especially come carnival time. Don’t let another carnival go by without your arrangements in effect.

John Settle is here. Oficina at Flamengo went well today as did Cacilda - both fairly steady.

Yesterday did the “não adianta ficar Putin” bloco on tuba and really didn’t feel like I had risked getting/passing on COVID. All open air. Was great actually - just want to help them make this better.

Came back home and made arrangement of “voce partiu meu coração” whilst sipping whisky. Fantastic.

By coincidence you just watched a Robert Greene video about consistency over passion and were just about to write that you need to commit to doing 1 pom of piano and 3 poms of brass band arranging first thing. That and the daily dozen études on trumpet gives you the « holy trinity ».

Point is that there are lots of other great immersive work projects that you should also spend time on: teaching materials, planning, recording arrangements, training video etc. So you can’t really commit to 3 hours of just arranging, but 3 pomodoros you can do and you can do almost all days. 1 more pomodoro practicing sax would be magic but at the moment it would be a bridge too far.

Last year you were looking for the name, and it eventually came: Brassify - an absolute corker. And now you’re not going to use it?

Favela Brass stressful at the mo. 2 trips to São Paulo and possibly one to Teresopolis in the next three weeks. The meeting with the social worker and lawyer was slightly depressing as the extent of the Estatuto da Criança e Adolescente becomes clear. Sitting down to talk with Livia in 2 weeks time and have to work out what position to take. Baile Brass was excellent with mixtape brass on Saturday. You oscillate between looking at the door and doubling down on stoic principles. You feel like you are doing the whole thing with a gun to your head because of Brazilian child and labour laws.

Loving every minute with Thamires. She’s a proper woman which means you have to do your job as a man. If and when you have kids, you’ll have to be getting paid. 

You have decided to make playing instruments a leisure activity in your mind. Piano doesn’t have to be in the morning straight after coffee - it’s a fantastic way to wind down and fill the hours if you have some time in the evening. Just because you make your living through music, doesn’t mean that you can’t have learning Bach chorales through the keys as a hobby.

2021

Getting ready for picnic tomorrow. Didn’t get permission from the prefeitura. That could cost you. If we don’t get stopped tomorrow, I’m happy.

Watched Gran Tourino. Made you think about Dad a lot. Things are different now. Thinking about writing big band charts in Jan. Good luck tomorrow mate.

2024 - EDM

Now coming up to 2 weeks without caffeine and general observations are:
1. You are more relaxed, and sleeping a lot.
2. Productivity dropped in the first couple of days, but now that all-day energy is kicking in. For example, you now feel like practicing piano at night.
3. You are more able to engage in conflict where needed. Have been a bit irritable, but the overall calmer thing makes tricky conversations easier.
4. Sense of humour is better.
5. Something is stopping you watching porn.

2020 - Aracaju

Fly back to Rio this afternoon. The first two weeks of the trip was good, especially getting with Adrienne and the food, but not relaxing. The problems with the noise in the house threw everything up in the air and the indecision took the fun out of a few days there. But once I had resigned myself to biting the bullet and getting into a hotel, and also didn’t have the pressure of Adrienne wanting to do stuff every day, I got into a really nice rhythm.

For future holidays I think getting a nice play to stay with a decent breakfast is worth the investment. Right next to the beach. A whole month in one place is a lot. Something like a week in Ilheus at that place that you saw on trip advisor looks good. 

Considering rolling the diary into the daily mise. It’s only a few minutes.

Thamires’ hormones are going a bit wild, so you’re definitely treading on eggshells a bit at home. Last night was a classic where she got upset because you ate the second half of her creme caramel - even though there were still two full ones to go at. You will look back at this and laugh. Ha.

Strange this business of doubting if the kid is yours. In my heart I think it is, but I’m not sure that Thamires didn’t cheat on you while you were away.

Loving the thing of zero tolerance piano practice. This gets you concentrating, gets you learning and gets you up in the morning. Working on number 6 in the Grieg book and enjoying the challenge.

Perhaps 90 minutes of arranging per day guaranteed is better than 180 per day sporadically.

2021

Back in Rio. Been here 4 days, have done an oficina at the Aterro, one at the Assuncao and shagged 2 girls - Andressa and Tayenne. You’re not shit out here. You’re having a big impact and that should only multiply now. This is your life, don’t look back.

With the Dad thing the funeral doesn’t matter. What hurts is that you even thought of going back when he was in hospital. That you told him you were off and he said “that’s terrible”. That you weren’t quicker to overrule Mum. It still feels like you abandoned him even if you didn’t go. He did so much for you, you shouldn’t have even considered it. You can’t make it right.

Turns out we might be able to use the old Rouanet project after all - why didn’t I run this past Fatima before? Anyway, IF the account at BB in Catete is working then Norton might be able to get some donations in for us this year. Fingers crossed.

UK has this new strain of covid so other countries are stopping flights from here. Let’s see.

Joe Hewitt likes the 1000 melódica band idea and says is going to put us on the first list of projects for the donor whatever that means. Wants us to involve 1500 kids and get some more movement in. 

see.

Listening to the Blinding Lights arrangement from Christmas 2020 made me think. That was the moment when Dad was truly proud of you and it really was a solid musical achievement. It’s not writing at the very highest level but it shows you do have the capacity to write at that level.

You have to get clear to do the brassify recordings (yes, with video). You have to put the kind of work in that you put in to get good on trumpet. You can’t wait. Put it first.

2019

Kenny & Will invited me out of dinner last night in Santa Teresa, but despite today being a public holiday I didn’t go. They were meeting on the late side (8-9) and I was too focused on getting things done with the full day today.

Great that you are cranking things out and Favela Brass is running on all cylinders, but you have to try to build in a little margin to do this things. This business of delegating the menial stuff (and even non-menial) is important. Create a SYSTEM.

Dad weaker today. It’s close. Had a good chat with Mum about the arrangements for the funeral, which seem to be making sense. Woke up exhausted this morning need to get some exercise.

Somulo finds that you haven’t done all the corrections and sends group messages to the board via email and WhatsApp. A very stressful start to Carnaval. Didn’t sleep well and though surdos e mundos and desculpe o transtorno were fun, you felt a
bit shitty. Should have brought a drum for Kenny as well. 

Went to Monique’s later on and had a monumentally crap pizza before crashing out.

2021

I’m grateful for the directors who volunteer their time for the project. It’s so much better than everything being on your shoulders in terms of accountability. And they want to pay you more. Great to have a team to think all these things through.

I’m grateful for having Edileuza as a student, and for being able to test my teaching materials straight away.

Loving the way the first trumpet grade 1 method book is coming out, with the baked-in theory and playing card scheme. Using this approach with Edileuza she really got to grips with reading rhythms and studies today. You have seen the way forward.

Worryingly long FB board meeting today - Mirela perhaps not the best for keeping an eye on the clock in meetings. Hope the next ones are tighter.

PRIO came through yesterday. You were in the middle of a day of interviews up at the Assuncao with Camila when the call came. Massive relief but still stressed.

It is now 3 in the morning on a day when you can ill afford to be sleep deprived. Your interview for the 10-years video and  Massive shot in the foot ordering burgers that arrived at 8pm.

You are starting to resent Thamires because she’s overeating, and resent yourself for doing the same. It feels like a betrayal that she’s letting herself go, and setting herself on the path to being a fat wife. She’s also being a massive nag, which isn’t magically going to go away when the hormones settle down.

Your own self-control is important here: YOU need to set the example food-wise and be preparing heathy alternatives; YOU need to stay on top of the chores at home; YOU need to grow the hell up, shut your trap and stop being such a bloody Frank Spencer.

Eating well is so central: cutting out alcohol and caffeine helps, but controlling your diet is the form of self control which makes the most difference.

Get on it!

DAILY NUGGET: maximizers/satisficers 

You’re clearly a maximizer. Everything has to have a 5-star review and it takes you forever to choose a film. You even ended up doing operational research at uni which is an entire field based upon maximization!

With that in mind you need to think about getting you to a place where that tendency works for you. It’s on the creative side, not stopping till that work is right, getting that band sounding tight, keeping on practicing piano every single day.

You also have to work on keeping the tendency in check and not dying alone.

Last few days before I head back to Brazil. Managed to get traveldoc.aero to change the details for my flight from CDG só should be ok this time. Keith Alderson is fixing the bass trombone hope he gets the slide decent.

Loving the piano practice. Stopped drinking midweek which was a good move. Was eating too much and that interferes with sleep which messes everything up. Anyway...

Still slogging away at Odara and learning lots along the way. Stugger wants to do a joint vid now so I need to come up with s suitable arrangement. Actually quite a bit of admin at the mo.

Practicing trumpet and piano in the evening is working at the mo. You write arrangements and exercise in the morning, you sort out the Favela Brass admin stuff in the afternoon, and you practice in the evening. Means all tricky decision making done by tea, and you can get a single-minded morning in.

Ahhhh and the meeze first thing seems to be a good idea - put the new important habit first. It just keeps everything manageable and keeps the stress down.

Dad a little better. Doctor thinks it might be an infection and will do blood tests tomorrow. Mum still thinking about taking him to family camp, which I have reservations about. He needs to take it easy and we need to be in touch of the local medical practice.

Distracting myself looking at hotels in Rio. Only one cup of tea today and feeling better. Nice bike ride round past Hayfield.

2023

Henry over to stay with you and Mum. Met up in York then ended up getting the wrong train and going back via London (luckily was a rail strike and didn’t get charged). Went to Yorkshire wildlife today and had a splendid Indian takeaway.

Had a thought: what if you launched a brass band every year, incorporating the latest crop from favela brass? Imagine the impact of that.

Been a very busy time. Just one full-on thing after another: Rouanet prestação, Paraty, Submitting ISS, Prêmio da Música Brasileira. Currently weighing on you is the Rouanet project for 2025, and the Rouanet project for the adult students. Also talking with Taylor takes a lot of time - 4 hour call yesterday basically did for the admin part of the day.

One very good thing is that you are maintaining the 3 hours of arranging first thing.

The good thing about the talk with Taylor was that it took you through the history of the project, which should be good for getting you thinking about the projects for next year: if success at Favela Brass looks like black musicians at Carnival, then you need to be getting more favela kids into the project. It also means that you need to be working at a decent scale.

Looking at the baile jazz option for your R$200.000 CNPJ Rouanet.

2023

Idea: on Wednesdays and Fridays when the lessons are on, you do your recording/lesson prep and practice sax. Joe isn’t in and you don’t eat into arranging time. It’s a good way to make this extra time work for you.

Another thing: Cris said that we don’t need to worry about getting back to Lívia because she’s « cozinhando « her - making her wait just to mess with her. Just like she does with you. She’s deliberate in the way that she works on people. Working with all women.

2021

Re-read the minutes of the last meeting. Nothing controversial in there. Sometimes, maybe most of the time, it’s you. Decent chat with Mirela about Rouanet stuff. Consultation with Fatima went great. Time to put your captação hat (wig?) with on. But, keep the evenings and weekends for making music.

Chatted with joe on zoom, keep this friendship you dickhead.

In terms of the Fatima chat one of the best ideas to come out was that of making each Rouanet project something different - could be grade 1 to 8. Could be recorder to saxofone, iniciante to maestro. Flexible start times. And also consider splitting it into different sub projects.

Favela Brass AGM. After a mad dash to get the relatório anual done only 4 of 8 turned up. Norton and Sômulo elected themselves Treasurer and Vice-President. Bulldozers are in the driving seat.

2022

Still got finger in a splint - didn’t manage to get it looked at in the hospital today. Gustavo, Stu Macdonald’s friend is here. Nice beer with him at Silvia’s last night. Senador Corrêa went well today, CIEP really bad attendance. Band at the assuncao sounding great - Anitta pretty much ready to record.

BCS fun run saturday - met some good contacts for Favela Brass, have them all my card but nobody in contact yet. Missed Ricardo’s 60th but I think it’s ok. Melissa is now on side against crazy Bindu - stressful but hopefully we’ll find a way out of this. Sômulo as treasurer singing tombe interesting.

Still off the caffeine and great energy, especially in the lessons. Now to finish the day with an episode of squid game.

2021

Notched down to green tea today, lethargy city - was worried I had COVID due to sniffles, what felt like a bit of fever (but didn’t come with temperature). Extra nap this morning - serious catch-up. Starting to get the upwards-spiral feeling. Didn’t drink yesterday - marathon 3-hour piano practice session. This is what you like. Throw some meditation in there.

Was due to have a hit girl from Tinder, Charlayne, over yesterday who has had the vaccine, but I cancelled it. Reading about the present situation in Brazil, and the fact that the vaccine doesn’t necessarily stop transmission I just didn’t fancy it. Also was feeling pretty tired anyway. You’re doing the right thing.

Had the idea on the piano yesterday to practice hearing modulations: take any progression, and take the PROGRESSION around different keys, in all different interval sizes. Could make Brainscape cards for this (V-I in fourths, etc.)

On Tuesday you got the students singing* In the Bleak Midwinter*. No doubt that they enjoyed the 4-part singing and what with them playing the parts on the melodica as well this is a very rich activity. These Tuesday night lessons are rekindling your love of teaching. The idea of giving the students a touch of Nadia Boulanger and the Paris conservatories is very appealing. Yesterday had the idea of 3-month modules/certificates. Maybe even giving them choices or even making them optional. With optional, some students could even do 5 days a week.

Also looking at getting them on to the Arban and Universal sax method after grade 3. Don’t know if this is complicating things too much when essential elements is to hand.

Another recent idea is that the Amigos da Cacilda is a band and bloco of all Favela Brass alumni. So when you think about the ending of your film, you’re going through the streets of Santa Teresa with hundreds of ex-students in the best bloco that Rio has ever seen.

PRIO have only put up R$900.000 for next year 

2020

Yesterday got the news that Favela Brass has won the R$50.000 Aldir Blanc grant. Best thing about it is that you don’t have to prestar contas, only show that you have been doing what you’d said you would do. I’m thinking that it would be a good idea to pay Joe, and maybe Amelia’s rent (c. R$14.000/year), maybe put some towards Curitiba (R$15.000) and save the rest - do for the project finances what you never did for yours….

We really need to have meetings, but Angelo has had surgery this week so it’s all behind. I guess just try and get a general meeting before you go back (maybe in person) so that whoever wants to can sign up as a UK trustee. Just use the fact that they aren’t doing anything to your advantage - put in your list of suggested trustees for March. Need to get on top of this, get clear what you want. Don’t change things like meeting days.

You’re in a decent rhythm now, but this morning you did a meditation where you imagined the years of your life as you counted up with the breath, and it wasn’t too pretty. Remember your Dad letting the word duty out when you had that chat in your mid-late twenties. You were a dud. Still are in many respects. Not just that, a “Think and grow rich” deluded dud.

As Dad said in that conversation, 65 isn’t the financial milestone, 40 is. You’re the wrong side of 40 now and officially a financial failure. Big time. The other duty is to pass the genes on. Spooned that as well, grandiose coward that you are. Dad said that money is a scorecard in terms of how you are doing and he’s right. You just didn’t get a hold of it. You didn’t get into the game.

It was all about making you happy. What a prick.

Morning with Monique. Sex mechanical - even though you went for ages no hint of her heading towards orgasm. Finally talked a bit a about her Dad and the situation with her brother and sister in law. She talked about being bullied at private school same as Talita. Now back on the fence about her, but do get the feeling that financial motives play a big part in her being with you.

Thinking seriously about switching to artistic director sooner rather than later. It’s a lot of stress and your flip-flopping decision style isn’t helping.

2021

Been without much energy last couple of days. Not sleeping great. Have to get your arse down to Ipanema to buy some tea so you can wean yourself off the coffee. Slight suspicion I might have the dreaded, can feel a little something on my lungs now. Definitely have something but feels like a cold.

Have been a bit hacked off with Amelia on the COVID front. Brazil has 3.000 dying a day and this new variant is more contagious. Hospitals full of younger people now. But no lockdown for Amelia, then she comes home and works out in the front room while Helayne is over cleaning. Not good. 

Method is looking so good now. All that theory baked in (compound interest). Great lessons with the Marias and Katarina who are really starting to read properly. Getting excited about the lessons again. Looking at target of one instrument/grade book a week. I think smash the beginners books across the instruments by the end of the year. Then intermediate and advanced next year.

So I’m grateful for having had finningley airship growing up, going up on the store with the ear protectors on. I’m very grateful for having had a piano to play on growing up.

I’m extremely grateful for having had the musical education I had - parents, Mars bars, mr Stubbs, saturday morning music center, senior orchestra, senior brass group, school band, Vermuden, Doncaster youth jazz, wavenden, McCauley school orchestra. dickie hawdon, Eddie Harvey. You were very lucky mate - you had the talent, but it only got developed with the right conditions.

Drank too much last night at cozinha da lapa cortejo yesterday. Like the equivalent of 8 pints. Stop this. Get some hard rules. No more than a drink an hour. Felt like absolute crap today but a bit better now. Discovered Canva in the morning. Things are going to start looking a lot better now.

Vedasom guys came round to put the door in today. They were a bit sloppy but it does stop the sound quite a bit. Means that you can record when others are out and they can practice when you’re out. Let’s hope Joe cooperates.

And that promise to Dad on his deathbed. Shall we make good on that?

2021

Still in limbo with Dad. At least they are sedating him now but he still has nasty coughing episodes with his lungs full of fluid. How this all progressed. I think he heard me today when I said how much I appreciated all he did for me and how I intend to start my band in Brazil and how if I can give them half what he gave me I will be very happy. 

Oficina at the Aterro went ok apparently but low numbers. It’s like herding cats. Mangueirinha x Cristiane looks problematic already.

Very low energy levels during day due to what I think is a cold plus the obvious situation.

The point of the above is that you are the thinker column down to a tee, as Favela Brass moves from the Launch Phase towards the Rapid Growth Phase. It’s just so on the money. Now, the fact that you’re in the thinker column does not mean that you now have to leave FB and be a penniless founder again. You can still make cool stuff for FB and get paid for it. Or you can use your reputation from FB to sell a project that has money for you in the budget.

Anyway, in the middle of recruiting new General Manager (one day Executive Director?) and stressing about it all. Extremely glad to have found the « Hire with your Head » book, but it’s still stressful. It just feels like you’re forever just doing things on the fly. Also have to sort out exams, produtora, hiring musical director, communications mess (fire Camila?), curry clube on Friday and the new Rouanet budget. Still thinking about Dad lots. It’ll be with you forever. Like the idea of imagining him watching over. 

Something occurred: you’re beating yourself up for being this useless, selfish little shit who didn’t just get on with life. That’s why you started Favela Brass: to be useful. So when you get all this backbiting and stress and criticism just think: you’re taking this for the frikking team - by putting yourself up there to be called a twat, you’re actually being a non-twat. Just sort yourself out with a girlfriend and you’ll be alright, dickhead.

And if you want to know what your dad hated it was you taking yourself too frikking seriously. All this pious self-help bullshit. And the best thing for that is watching comedy, which, in fact may be the big missing thing from books like the antidote and 4,000 weeks. Just take it all with a pinch of salt and get on with it.

Listening to Julio Jaramillo after hearing about him from the guitar player at café Bagdad - lovely stuff. 

Offered to help with BCS newsletter today. Clumsily, as usual. But, in binary terms, you did it. Now have to do a good newsletter. 

Have made the decision to focus on fundraising now certainly till July holiday, probably till Christmas - your performance in your job at FB will be judged primarily on your ability to get the cash in. And even your performance on the program side depends on the cash to delegate. Right now, the cash comes first - this is your WIG till the end of the year. 

Also, with the format done for the Gabarito method it feels like all the method stuff has reached its logical conclusion: it’s a great system - just make the books (maybe have a bash in the 2 weeks at the end of July or first 2 weeks of august) and surely you’re good for teaching material till the end of the year.

Felt absolutely bushed this afternoon before and after the BCS meeting and ended up retiring to bed and listening to the Laws of Human Nature. A lot of important lessons in there.

Today was the chapter on grandiosity and the cap definitely fit in some ways. Love Freud’s idea of the “oceanic feeling”. Keep your feet on the ground. Ever since uni it has been one grandiose idea after another - the latest being an exam board for Brazil. Build real success and get in the flow by focusing on smaller, shorter-term, practical goals - like getting favela brass funded, for example. 

And, by the way, “save live music” as a life mission is *super* grandiose.

Nice reading the 2021 diary. Standard way up in Favela Brass over the last 3 years and they are getting there with the reading.

When you were growing up you had school and you had music. It seems natural for you to handle admin/business stuff during the day and as long as you stick to the Trollope regime 05:30-08:30 weekdays you’re on track artistically. The life that you’re now starting in Engenho do Mato is going to be less compatible with teaching and gigging in Rio. So you need to make your money doing online admin during the day. Projects of Lei de Incentivo seem like a good way to go.

2021

Ok morning, deliberating about the method/exams/Ed thing but found great public domain tunes pdf book and structured the rhythmic progression. Long walk up top saw a toucan, a family of gambás, and discovered why they are called macaco pregos.

Starting to work on double bass playing now which is great. Also have it in my head to learn violin. You’re coming on great as a musician.

But... had a moment during lesson with Lucia when I thought - what have I got to show for 7 years of the school? Nobody who could read the Guru chart, who could sit in with even the stage band. You have a smattering of beginner and lower intermediate musicians. The Guri thing showed us up a bit.

I’m grateful to Angela for the free chilli sauce she sneaked me today. I’m grateful to the person who just gave a Yamaha flute to the project.

I’m very grateful to have Alberto Goyena as a friend and teacher at the project - he is absolutely going to town on the teaching over the pandemic as well as donating to the project and generally being a very very nice and supportive chap. You have great friends, you just need to learn to treat them properly.

Walk thoughts:

Favela brass don’t pay you as arranger and don’t own your charts

Don’t forget you can always commission a van to go on to Ciep after largo do Machado on saturday mornings (could grab students from CIEP and take to the community as well!)

You should not create a system based on you being the only band director - this is what will limit the project

Don’t forget the teachers Christmas video 

1 private student pays for 1 FB student 

What if the TBS and American school oficinas weren’t mixed with FB kids - just finance oficinas in other places 

Work with existing school teachers for oficinas at schools but WE pay them, maintaining 1/1 funding ratio 

Band arrangements work GREAT for blocos - you only need to limit turmas to a brass band for certain shows, tours etc.

You should take beginner and advanced groups - like Mr Woodward

Think half a dozen tunes at each of the 5 band levels. Then maybe turma 2 does levels 1-2, turma 1 does 2-3 and pro band 3-4

2019

Stressing about Carola. On Wednesday had another frustrating day. Trying to find a nice for her on the admin side of things, but even that is difficult: she started accusing me of not using documents that she had prepared, when in fact it was just one parental agreement form from 2017 that wasn’t suitable for now: we then spent the day revising that document, with Carola insisting on things I didn’t want, link a 3-day minimum for parents to let us know that kids aren’t coming to a rehearsal.

The she says she’s got a good team coming together, then I suggest that since I am running the project, that I should be in direct contact with any prospective new staff or partners, she flies off the handle about me being controlling.

Carola left the project, then you called her to let her know that Rouanet had passed and she came back. That’s done now, but the challenge now is how to get her “out of your hair” in terms of running the project, without creating an ugly scene with the new trustees. It would be good to have Carola helping with certain things, especially grant-writing, benfeitoria and finding new gigs, also admin bits. But “produtora”of the project she isn’t, and she needs to know that.

Feijoada at Claudio’s fir St. George’s day.  Went back fir seconds - bloody gorgeous! He wanted me to bring some kids probably thinking that maybe they would play a bit but I let him down. Just not the moment. Told Amélia that having others over in the house isn’t particularly comfortable. 

I’m grateful for my hidden meditation rock. It’s brilliant because nobody seems to go there and it’s a perfect 45-or so bike ride up to it. Standing up on the rock and listening to the eagles is one of life’s finer pleasures!

I’m grateful for heavy feijoada, and for

Picked up Zola three weeks ago (seems longer). She’s busy destroying everything in the house, but picking up the commands well in the morning training sessions and of course is lovely! She’s growing fast - must be 11-12kg at this point (4 and a bit months). Good chance she’ll turn into a bit of a bruiser.

Started implementing EOS at Favela Brass and it seems to be the way forward. Last week’s first accountability chart session went very well, especially in that it put Wesley above Cris, and Cris out of the leadership team. Sad to say it, but the exercise really brought him how well the organization could do without Cris (she didn’t go to the pedagogic meeting yesterday and the vibe was more professional without her).

Family Systems Theory talks about the damage that “triangulation” can do to a system and I see that dynamic in evidence with Cris’s impact on Favela Brass. Just take a look at her Whatsapp message about  Wesley:

*“Eu juro que estou tentando me comportar mas está difícil. Wesley tem que tratar os alunos com equidade. Parar de escolher alunos preferidos. Principalmente quando os alunos que ele resolve deixar de lado são os meus filhos e os da Angélica (que fala mesmo). Eu não vou ter essa conversa com ele pq ele vem com aquela vozinha de minha amiga... E eu não estou com vontade. Mas acho que seria legal um dia fazermos alguma dinâmica com todos os professores para eles reforçarem essa coisa da igualdade, equidade e sei lá mais o que.  Sem atritos, nem conflitos. E talvez a pessoa mais indicada para direcionar isso seja a AS. Que acabou de chegar e ainda não presenciou nada. Pq eu tenho visto umas paradas esquisitas nas segundas, mas como ele se coloca como o carta branca para mim e os professores acabamos não levando nada pra vc. Mas cansei. Preciso te deixar a par das coisas que tenho observado.  Ele é maravilhoso em 1 quilhão de aspectos. Mas é um lider opressor.  Ele não te representa nem de longe. Qd vc falou que entregaria a banda 1 para ele quase infartei.  Mas pensei no lado técnico e tal... Só que ele não dura nem dois meses na mão da banda 1. As crianças vão comer com batata.*
*
*
*Desculpa tudo isso mas não sou baú. *
*A menina dos iniciantes nunca disse que aceitava o trombone. Eu estava ao lado dela. E ele falou que ela aceitou. Pq ele decidiu. Mesmo sabendo que o menino ia pra percussão ele insistiu que ela ia para o trombone. Isso me arranha a alma.  Causar essa angústia na criança. O Guilherme choranfo que não queria sopro e ele dizendo que ia pro trompete! Aff. Parei.”*

If Cris upped and left tomorrow, wouldn’t you glad to see the back of all this?

2022

Forgot all about the lesson at GEO today. Knock-on from getting drunk on Sunday - your brain isn’t working. This will cost you. It just won’t do. Sort it out.

Started recording in new room. Promising. But you can’t neglect the day job.

2021

Quite possibly just left Dad to die. It’s bad news either way tomorrow morning - either he’s dead and I left him or he’s alive and has to live another day of hell. He was there tonight, squeezing my hand, listening to nuages. So hard leaving him. Tough conversation this morning with the consultant - trying to make clear that reducing suffering is the main thing.

Why does it seem like I’m the only one in the family who’s bothered about him dying alone?

2020

Better frame of mind now. Spent the last few days concentrating on the websites - was a good idea and they are done now and looking good on desktop and mobile. Solid progress feels good just have to think of the next task now. It’s between a week on the videos, the Sukiyaki videos and Lei Rouanet. In theory Amelia could do Sukiyaki and Carola Rouanet, but Amelia has been pretty slow with stuff and not sure how much faster it will be to get Carola on the Rouanet.

Angelo isn’t calling board meetings or communicating with the accountant which is holding everything up with the board. It would be better to talk about the Carola decision with the board first. I don’t want this to drag. Be good to see her and Stugger next week, then meet up afterwards to fire her. Then you’re pretty much straight off down to London anyways. Seems a bit like a hit and run, but the important thing is to do get it done.

Been looking at a list of the 20 most beautiful cities in Brazil - now that the real is weak it makes sense to travel within Brazil - and everyone has seen Europe. In a quandary about what tech to buy - whether to splash out on a 16” MacBook Pro which will cost £2150 but do everything you need. Or to think about how much freedom and travel that is when expressed in Reais. To be fair, I haven’t run out of processing power yet. But it’s been pretty tricky with the lack of HD space.

My phone is dinging away with messages from lovely Brazilian ladies - life will be very good when this Corona thing is over!

DAILY NUGGET - THE INFJ

Two personality tests have put you down as an INFJ - the rarest personality type for a man. More specifically an INFJ-A - or the Assertive Advocate (assertive as opposed to turbulent advocate ). I mean, it’s all one step off a horoscope, but it’s food for thought as well. Here’s the career bit:

*Advocates’ needs may be hard to meet in some work environments, especially those that offer little independence and agency. Advocate personalities are sometimes drawn to behind-the-scenes and noncompetitive roles, but these jobs can lead to frustration if they don’t allow Advocates to act as they see fit, grow as individuals, and make a difference.*
*
*
*For this reason, people with the Advocate personality type may feel fulfilled by seeking out leadership positions or by starting their own business. By finding jobs that offer more autonomy, Advocates can focus on applying their creativity and integrity to everything they do. Advocates may also find it gratifying to create bridges between seemingly disparate professional fields – for example, by writing about psychology or by being an environmental lawyer. These hybrid careers can offer plenty of opportunities for Advocates to exercise their creativity and their love of learning.*
*
*
*Where Advocates struggle is in work that doesn’t take personal needs into consideration, is overly repetitious, or promotes conflict. Jobs with these characteristics can leave Advocates frustrated and unfulfilled. People with this personality type may also chafe at the criticism and pressure that come with cutthroat, competitive work environments.*
***## 
***
*In truth, Advocate personalities can do well in any field. To be truly happy, however, they need to find work that aligns with their values and allows them some independence. Advocates crave opportunities to learn and grow alongside the people they are helping. When this happens, Advocates may finally feel as if they are fulfilling their life’s mission, contributing to the well-being of humanity on a personal level.*

[If only personalities were that simple…]

2025

Building work on the upstairs of the house in its early stages, but seems to be going ok. Fábio already making noises that it might run over time - he’s saying 3 months now, which would mean mid-April. That’s right on the line baby-wise.

Productive if not particularly long day’s work - managed to carve out an hour at the start to write music (trying to do something with Stanton Warriors “The Antidote” as a starting point). Rob Fletcher is going for it with the databases. Starting to think that we have to limit the numbers in the lessons in the favela now. With a 15% attrition rate, you need 121 in the project and 25 coming in each year. That’s plenty. Big is vulnerable - and the noises coming from Ivan and the sisters about the Assunção aren’t encouraging.

10 years video project difficult going in-between Taylor and Maria. Camila being extremely annoying as usual and not doing her part as well. Not one I’d hire again. Having said that I think the video will turn out well. Fingers crossed…

Nice online meeting with Rolf from the Biquinis de Ogodó - looks like we’re on for Cacilda in Ilha Grande.

Yesterday the dog known as Catinga got her paws run over as she was running alongside you and Zola. Was looking very much like you and Thamires would take her to the vet and then adopt, but Priscila who lives next to the padaria took her in. Lovely dog but it would be a bold step given that you have a baby on the way and a 6-week trip to the UK planned. Tricky.

Then today you and Zola were bitten by the psycho dog on the road down to Ancestral. You could have handled it all a bit better, but then again you’re human. What was worse though was coming home to Thamires who was too preoccupied with chewing you out for leaving the front door open (again), to show any interest whatsoever in the fact that you just got bitten. She just chewed you about what you said or didn’t say to the owners. 

You have to take some responsibility here - you could do a lot better around the house, and you’re not shagging her enough. But Christ almighty I hope this is a phase, because the baby isn’t even born yet and there is a very long, difficult road ahead.

2023

Long day. Actually a bit of a blueprint day: bike ride (+pushups), piano, then 12 work pomodoros and corresponding Bousquet etudes. That’s a real daily dozen, although with lessons afterwards (getting kids ready for first ever FB exams), it’s intense. In indecision hell over candidates for General Manager and Produtora. Anyway the comedy videos help at the end of the day.

In fact just this interview process shows why you shouldn’t manage the project: everything changes.

2021

First up: thinking more about the mamãe eu quero video idea you almost got into involving other youth projects and bands and making it a mass video. That may have worked but right now I’m glad we didn’t go in that direction. There is a tendency with you to make things too complicated. Keep that in mind.

Had 3 beers yesterday as reward for not drinking all week. The not drinking bit was better than the reward. What if you did one week with no booze, no caffeine, exercise each day etc. just doing all the right things for one week only?

An example. Yesterday you had your misto gringo on the corner and Lívia passed by. You said hi but she ignored you. You then ignored her back. Spent the morning ruminating about why she now hates you and the world is turning against you, and how you’re going to sideline her kids.  Then you saw her in the evening and turns out she needs glasses and didn’t see you.

Two big ones down today. Started on BCS email bulletin and it’s already looking good. In fact this may even be fun - and a chance to see what it’s like to be a journalist. And the other one was the guri Google meet apresentação thing that went almost exactly as expected if not a bit better.

Maybe you shouldn’t plan the next 8 years of Favela brass. Maybe you should let others have their say, and just focus on funding next year. Guri makes you think though... what about this isn’t scaleable?

Great Baile last night with Cacilda being the invited band. Your chops fell off and there wasn’t much repertoire left over after Favela Brass played all the pop stuff, but it was still ok. Good to do the first baile each year with Cacilda. Tiê’s Mum trying to take you aside for a talk (which you didn’t allow), and then ended up keeping Wesley till quarter to 11.

Courage. Robert Greene’s idea of the counterbalance. In quite a few situations at Favela Brass you need to employ this - be the person who has the balls to say what needs to be said, whether it’s a rebuke, an apology, or even a thank you.

2021

Splendid day! Green tea in the morning gave just the right vibe to completely go off the rails and spend 3 hours planning how it work financing this thing through private school students, but by the end of it it was looking pretty good. This is scalable now - how many students should Favela Brass have? How many rich parents are willing to pay R$250 a month for lessons? Times that by 3.

Headed out at 3:30 in the approved fashion, ran/walked to Leme, then swam up almost to posto 2 before remembering that there are actually 5 postos on Copacabana hence to get to the fort is a bit of a marathon. Liking this triathlon idea - one day a week riding (over tops then back via beaches =50km), one swimming (Posto 1 - Posto 3 is 1.5km) and one running (Praia Vermelha to Posto 12 is just over 10km). Full triathlon would be cycle over tops, round to Posto 3, swim to Posto 1, then run back home.

Got very lucky yesterday! Turns out that the airl from tinder that I didn’t go to the beach with yesterday, Kayra, is living in Pereira right next to ABCD. Had lunch with her at ABCD and the rest went well. She is very, very beautiful, clearly has a great business sense and has done really well to create her modelling agency, and also seems down to earth and honest. Only minor detail so far is that she lives in Piauí…

Turned down Alex’s offer of going to Novo Friburgo. That was a mistake - minimum Covid risk, good networking and would have got you out of making curry on Sat and hence being pressured to shag Ingrid, which could make things awkward with other girls coming over for curry club in the future. The book about fear (“fear is fuel”) was right - you almost missed out on Kayra through fear (of taking a girl to the beach), and the Friburgo trip was another fear-based (of social awkwardness) missed opportunity.

2019

Missing Talita. I understand the reasons why I ended it, but I still miss her. I now know that the fact that I don’t have the “this is definitely the one”feeling of certainty is no because of the girl: it’s you. The feelings, emotional connection we there - only after finishing (and during finishing) could you properly appreciate that. No that that we should get back together, but definitely coming to the conclusion that if I wait for the Disney romance I’ll be waiting a long time. They’re all a bit nuts - and so are you!

Today is Erick Ramalho’s prog-rock gig at the British School. It is also Flamengo vs River Plate in the final of the ‘libertadores’ cup. I don’t think we’re going to have a driver, a full ban, or an audience. I think that even if we set off at 6pm, we’re not going to make it. I just can’t see any way round this.

Nearly there with the estatuto for Favela Brass - Lucca has sent a final draft to the other lawyers. Want to try and get the existing trustees together before Christmas. The one I’m worried about is Sandra. I think she may try to get Carola into the meetings of the trustees, and I have the feeling that she may be a bit forceful in meetings. Team player issues.

Stressy day as São Paulo trip approaches. Patrícia just not getting to grips with the itinerary and even suggesting that we could plan things out and make reservations on the bus down. Not a good sign. Started going to the gym in Engenho do Mato and enjoying that. 

2021

Mildly interesting day. In the morning got a proper coffee buzz and did the first full group lesson with reading exercises etc. mixed instruments, mixed abilities. As always you think it’s the most amazing discovery that is going to change everything. That said, I do think this, combined with the new 1 tune, 2 keys transposition charts, is going to pull things together nicely. End of the day, one decent bandleader with a good method is better than a bunch of volunteer teachers going off half cock.

Had a wave of stress as the admin hit but seem to have it under control now. Doing a HASfit and then tidying up helped with the stress. Listened to the AOM Oliver Brookman episode all about the futility of time management methods. Got me thinking and tied in with a lot of thoughts around Dad’s death. Just have to take it on the chin: your time here is finite, as will be your legacy. Learn to take pride in small things, and accept you won’t get it all done.

Ah, and Stugger and Carola are getting married in August. He hinted he wants me to come. We’ll have to see about that.

Enjoying being home with Mum. And lovely to have a bit of time off. Feels like I’m playing the wrong role. I should be bringing my family over to fill the house, in the Dad role. But I’m coming over still as the son. Like I’m still 19.

Except that you’ve got a business now. PRIO talking about depositing the rest of the money now which will help a lot. Ordered a custom pink favela brass T-shirt for Cris. You don’t trust her but still try to keep her onside to a certain extent - she’s dangerous.

Loving recording the arrangement of Antihero.  Just want to do more of this 

2020

Oli’s wedding on Monday was a very low key affair think they just wanted to get it out of the way. You did a trumpet voluntary which sounded good but may or may not have been appreciated. Really important not to judge these things, let people do things their own way and be supportive. Do think it’s a bit awkward Louise becoming Mrs. Wilson rather than Mrs. Ashe

Putting the finishing touches to blinding lights arrangement and video. If you make the videos that will help to keep motivated to keep on pumping out big band repertoire and also be good promotion for you and favela brass. You love it. Now about that bari sax...

Angelo doesn’t like the sports creative idea. Thinks it smacks of off-mission grant chasing that won’t leave a legacy. Has a vision of kids learning melódica for a bit then being let down when they can continue. Doubts we can handle the numbers long term.

I let Joe know that we need a strong plan for the board. Also that we could do an event at each school to guarantee 1500 students and chill out about the Guiness book of records, but if we chill out on that we miss the main thing for us which is the melódicas in mass. 

I felt like a bit of a Stugger talking to Angelo without solid plan. Have to think this through. And make document for board, urge. But try and relax mate, it’s xmas.

Went out to Canton with Geoffrey and Margo and got blind drunk. Never doing that again. Thamires gave the idea to have 80 days off booze, which I think was a good one.

3 principles for living well (becoming who you are):

1. Ask yourself, is this behaviour I admire?
2. It’s not just what you get done, but also how you live (rituals).
3. Let your regrets teach you.

2021

I’m grateful for my health. Just watching Robert Greene talking about his stroke and how it took outdoor exercise away from him. That must be terrible. It’s just fantastic jumping on the bike or jogging up the hill into all that leafy solitude and you should not take it for granted.

I’m grateful for the fact that I can cook curry, and I’m grateful that they sell kitkats   in Brazil.

Thought more about the project with Ed. Thinking that you have to pare it down to one offering, that that offering should be what you’re writing now, and that you should work towards a monetizable app. My god how a 2 hour walk in the woods helps to sort the ideas out!

App can be sold internationally and monetized but still given away for free where needed. I printed the trumpet grade 1 book so far and it looks great. You, Ed and a tech person could do it. Get the minimum viable project out there and test it - can start with a book to test it an app is worth it. 

Teachers want products that will teach their kids the real stuff - proper reading and theory. Maybe it won’t be an app - maybe a physical thing, but the musical playing card flashcard idea is great. A teaching tool to structure the technical stuff and get the kids practicing at home. Not a whole on-line course.

Think: US band leaders could give this to their students and they can use it to work on their technical skills. And the ribbons give it that vital edge.

“What I am is all the result of the direst need” - Haydn

In your case this was lacking. Only now are Favela Brass and the prospect of family compelling you to get the house in order.

“My prince was always satisfied with my works. Not only did I have the encouragement of constant approval, but as conductor of an orchestra I could make experiments, observe what produced an effect and what weakened it and thus I was in the position to improve, to alter, to make additions or omissions and be as bold as I pleased. I was cut off from the world, there no one to confuse or torment me, and I was forced to become an original.”

Wouldn’t that be lovely?

Still mulling over the regrets blueprint idea. We’re talking about the regrets that have stayed with you. Which category most applies? Foundational, boldness, moral, connection? I think probably foundational and connection, not necessarily in that order. You didn’t hold your end up in terms of making money, finding a wife and having kids, and you weren’t there for friends and family.

So is that the way forward now?

First day for ages that I didn’t do the full tpt practice - seems like you really need to get that done first thing. Also no energy for piano today.

Very happy to be back doing a little 75-90 min deep work slot in the mornings now, and the focus on making the grade 1-5 books this year is definitely a good call. That’s about as good as I can do for now - this fasting thing takes a bit of getting used to!

Last night had the whole indecision and self-flagellation thing about the interview process. Just the most horrible feeling - calling yourself an incompetant indecisive eedjut who shouldn’t be allowed to go out of the house, let alone run and NGO. Then sorted it out in the morning. Dude, don’t forget the negative capability thing. Whether it’s what Keats meant or not, you have to be able to tolerate that things might not go right, or you might look a twat, or your might upset someone. You have to be able to tolerate the not knowing, the sense that maybe you’re screwing it all up, being a dick, making a fool of yourself without pulling the plug. If you’re going to make stuff you have to be able to deal with risk, imperfection, things maybe not working out and take it all with a pinch of salt and god forbid a sense of humour. It’s either that or going and living in a cave.

Ah and another thing: stop being so frikking creepy. Just think about what creepy people do and don’t do that.

Watched *All Quiet on the Western Front. *Good for putting things in perspective.

The other thing is that you seem like a bona fide hsp (highly sensitive person). Both diagnoses are helpful. You need to do less, avoid management roles, stick to the creative stuff. Cut down (or out) the caffeine and booze, exercise loads, and meditate. And spend lots of time at the piano.

Went out to Joe’s first gig at cozinha da Lapa with Kenny, Alexandre and Richard. Did Kenny’s new year ritual (which was a bit clunky) and played a solo with Joe’s band. Drank too much (4 Heineken latões) but had a good drunken debate with Alexandre about hitters future of music. He things it’s going to be tech-driven. Wrong. 

Kenny went without saying anything or even replying to messages and I told him I thought it was a bit weird today. Maybe I over reacted but I didn’t like it especially after the New Year bonding ritual. Anyway he went to the trouble to bring a bottle of wine round so definitely back in the good books.

Somulos BNDES thing - bit boring and embarrassing you not remembering all the monthly donors. But positive - this is a move in the right direction. You have a good board team work on getting a good vibe going.

Had the idea of polos for Favela Brass. You have one in Santa (AP1) and one in Flamengo (AP2), each with schools flowing in - don’t try and get all the kids together at once. Do one oficina central at Flamengo and the other in Santa. Keeps numbers in each oficina manageable.

You have the Assunção - use it! Get into the schools that feed into it. Only thing is the whole drugs traffic thing. You would be raising the local profile again when you were kind of looking to sidestep all that.

Think... one oficina is let’s say one teacher each for trom, sax, tpt and Perc. Plus one horn and one perc for main rehearsal, and you for other bit. 7 profs, R$1.260 a week 60.000 a year. Each school is 2 profs and you need 3 feeder schools for an oficina. So that’s another 1.080 a week gives about 100k a year per polo in teachers, with capacity at 96 at central oficina and 72 in perc/recorder lessons. R$60 a student just teacher costs.

2 polos gives room for private students - CEAT for Santa. Liceu for Flamengo. Also eliminates transport costs. Think: would the students in Santa really go to Flamengo every week?

Still thinking about this idea of you being the guide in the whole Favela Brass story, rather than the hero. It makes sense on a lot of levels:

- It means you don’t want to play in Cacilda in the end - you want them to take it and run with it

- Your lesson is all about teaching students how to “use the force”, rather than just being musical robots

- It means your own doubts and struggles aren’t the focus - you can just be the competent, down-to-earth coach that in reality is what is needed from you

- Even with the admin side of Favela Brass, there’s a lot of power in you adopting the posture of someone helping the team and board to move solve their problems themselves rather than being the big leader

- It unties you from the day to day of Favela Brass long term - Rio had this problem, you were on hand to show them the way to sort it, and then they take it and run with it.

Another night with Kayla last night but tonight she seems to have flaked. Should have walked her to the door lazy. But not particularly fussed in any case - wasn’t as much spark yesterday, a lot of time her on the mobile phone. She is extremely hot though, would be good to go to town at least once when she’s not flying the Japanese flag...

Mental note: always have at least some food and drinks in at home - even just a beer or two and some Doritos would have made the difference. Get a decent sofa. Sort your pad out.

Rouanet setbacks... Dan reckons his company has gone cold, and they have shelved our application because we’re too late for a project that represents an annual plan. Fátima is sending an appeal but I don’t think it’s looking good. Man, if you hadn’t said anything about Rouanet to Dan you could have got the cash. Fool.

Anyway, you should put a budget together for next year based on what you have. Then think about what you would do with more. Setting up finance meeting for Thursday with Melissa. So much to talk about it’s hard to know where to start...

Putting in solid pomodoro days in your non-caffeinated state. Accepting that what gets done within the “container” gets done and the rest you have to deal with the consequences.

Liceu Moliere event went well. Back at the fort in Urca. Good positive vibe with the kids. Sad to say but I think the absence of Maria Fernanda and Kaio may have a lot to do with that. Met new head Antoine and invited PTA to come to Hedi’s. Sômulo not there - sounds like he’s fallen out with them which is awkward.

Friday night did the first event with the Brits coming to see Joe at Hedi’s. A good time was had by all, Margo and Judy really enjoyed themselves and Geoffrey and Gabi got absolutely twatted. The next day had crazy ideas of bringing a different group every week (Brits/Cacilda/liceu/FB) and/or rehearsing kids at Mazinho’s on Fridays with a little show at 7:30. Even thought about a show after at Mazinho’s, but not sure I have the energy for a gig starting at 11pm.

Did the whole hotel thing tonight but no bird. Days Inn in Lapa: not too bad but sound coming in from the street. Just so good to sleep on a decent bed. Have a decent shower. 

Did 6 hours of piano practice today. 30 mins in the morning (which was stupid, messed up your prep for the show) then 11 pomodoros from 16h on. That’s more than you used to do in a week. Maybe daily missions would be better than cutting everything up.

I’m grateful for not having to do a gratitude journal any more. Baby Thiago waking us up at night, but much worse for Thamires. 

Discovered AI and it’s changing everything. Working on the Copa da Cacilda idea not sure if it’s a great idea or a terrible distraction.

2021

I’m extremely grateful for my ability to improvise. It’s a gift, in the sense that I’m very lucky to have been blessed with it. It’s the highest form of expression. Tô be able to sit at the piano and turn out baroque counterpoint is immensely enjoyable and satisfying.

I’m grateful for playing cards. There’s something about them that makes me happy - maybe memories of playing bridge on the family holiday to Italy. And I’m grateful for green tea in the afternoon to restart the day.

2022

British school in morning ostensibly to check what sound equipment is at the Botafogo site for the BCS, but Zezo had hidden agenda of trying to rope me into a class 5 band program at barra. It’s a temptation.

Governance committee meeting went well - finally getting to grips with board recruitment and strategic planning. An an first thing worked on Brassify video format - laying score over video with filter of Carnaval scenes.

2020

Woken in the night by a call from David Merrylees from the BCS which buggered up my sleep. But straight after the call did have a slurry of breakthroughs in terms of MLT thoughts. 

Have been practicing pieces around the keys on the piano and when I went to have a noodle on the piano at home yesterday, things started opening up in terms of modulating between keys. Only in the middle of the night did I realise that a lot of the modulation that was now coming naturally was the middle section of the Bach piece that I had been studying.

Started to think in terms of a wire mesh that represents what you can “hear” - maybe the auditory cortex. Sitting at the piano, determined by all I have listened to before, things that I want to play pop up, but they only get played if I can “reach for them”. Almost like proprioception - you can sense where you want to move your arm to - but can you make it go there?

The ability to play something that you hear is tied more to mechanical movement. It’s direct. The key question is: have I done something like this before? How many times? Learning through feedback is absolutely relevant here and the theory comes in more as a way to calculate how to find things you want to practice, and contextualize that which you already know, rather than to achieve direct proficiency. 

Once things start getting hairy, theory becomes less and less useful in the task of comprehending the link between the sound and the instrument. This starts to become apparent when modulations come in, but also points to the limitations of the chord/scale approach to jazz improvisation. These relationships need to be “felt” and “seen”. The powerhouse of all of this is visuo-spatial to auditory learning. The theory is like an overlay, a ruler, and you will never play a game of football well if you  have to measure each step with a ruler first - it is posterior learning that acts as a scaffold for future study.

That is not to denigrate theory entirely. There is the kind of gestalt understanding which doesn’t have a visual or spatial form, the “ghost” that transfers between keys. Theoretical understanding aids this sense of context. Knowing what something is not only by where it is on the instrument, but also by theory. 

A way of theorize this might be thinking in terms of different aspects of performing a given motif. You have the wire-mesh, where you can hear the idea that you want to reach for, you have the flesh and blood, physical connection where you can reach for it on the instrument, and you have ruler of theory, where you can pull up a conscious understanding of what is going on when needed. These three things feed the ghost of gestalt understanding and creativity.

Reading about the neuroscience of music has helped here - auditory cortex, motor areas, visual cortex, gestalt understanding and also the limbic system, emotional circuits all coming together. Back to Amersterdam, the more that fires, the stronger the emergent understanding. Just like consciousness, the ghost of musical understanding arises from the connections between all of these areas.

When I pick up a new instrument the theory, the auditory signal and the gestalt understanding are there. Even the visuospatial in there in the form of the piano representation running in the background. All that is needed is time playing, to create the direct connections to the specific movements of this instruments to the gestalt.

Just look up “gestalt psychology” and read the phrase “The whole is other than the sum of its parts” - Kurt Koffka. Never was that more true than in learning music - it links directly to Amsterdam. The ghost emerges. Also “Gestalt principles are in the mind, not the eye”. Just like how ear training is in the brain and nervous system, not the ear. And “Gestalt psychology is the examination of our senses versus perception.”

Another thing to think about is the observation that the chess masters distinguish themselves from mere mortals almost exclusively on the amount of plays that they are familiar with. And what is the mechanism for harmonic progressions to become “familiar” to the musician? They need to go through all the keys (preferably on the piano), with theoretical understanding. Theory creates almost like a second window, a programming consul, with a technical read-out of what’s going on the music - a different way of perceiving it which feeds the gestalt.

The senses is the “muscle-memory” of playing a specific motif on an instrument, whereas the perception is the gestalt understanding of music. Also think in terms of “anticipatory headroom” - the chess master can anticipate the impending options, and in music, especially harmony it’s a similar thing. Remember how when you’re improvising you often predict your next “stock” phrase and then give it a twist? You understand the expections, working with, and against them. Chess.

This is good:

_http://rebirthofreason.com/Articles/Maurone/Beyond_Emotion_The_Gestalt_Theory_of_Music.shtml__
_
_
_
“In musical situations where people do not have expectancies…the music will be meaningless for them.

“So far as music is concerned, the argument from here…when people here a sequence of tones, they group these into perceptual units which will be as ‘good as the prevailing conditions allow.’ Assuming that they can do this with some success, the sequence of tones will become meaningful, and will be a ‘tune’ in the sense in which we have previously defined tunes.”

Davies continues: “This tendency to organic separate units into some sort of whole is one of the central tenets of Gestalt psychology. Kurt Koffka…one of the pioneers of the Gestalt approach to perception, further postulated the ‘law of Pragmanz,’ or ‘law of the best figure’: According to this, there is a natural tendency for observers to prefer the simplest and most stable figure available to them; unfortunately he does not offer an explanation for the terms ‘simple’ or ‘stable’. Applying the law of Pragnanz to the Gestalt theory, Koffka reasoned that ‘The psychological organization will always be as good as the prevailing conditions allow. The act of perception therefore seeks to impose the best and most stable organization possible upon the percepts available…”.
 
The law of Pragmanz predicts why movable Do on an instrument doesn’t work - we’re trying to force children to think in terms of a more complex system than that which is presented to them physically. Whatever you do has to be at least grounded in the more simple physical figure that is presented to them - I.e. the fixed notes of the instrument.

“When music goes out of its way to violate the very expectations that it sets up, we call it ‘expressive.’ Musicians breathe ‘feeling’ into a piece by introducing minute deviations in timing and loudness. And composers build expression into their compositions by PURPOSELY [emphasis mine] violating anticipations that have been established.”

“Jourdain rounds out the theory with a kinesthetic idea of musculature representation: “…if music does not channel directly to our muscles, then we must consciously put it there. It seems that we use our musculatures to represent music, modeling the most important features of musical patterns by means of physical movements large and small. At one extreme, we bounce up and down to a pulsing beat. At the other, we are immobile yet are racked by anticipations of movement, experiencing the impetus toward motions that we do not actually initiate.” He cautions us, however, that “this view is necessarily speculative, since there is no science of muscular representation. For that matter, there is no hard-and-fast typology of physical movements or of musical devices by which we could compare sonic and somatic experience…yet it is easy to imagine two functions, that such representations would serve. First, representation provides a sort of notation system in which we momentarily inscribe features of music as it passes by, and thereby more easily remember those features over many seconds… A second function of muscular representation is to amplify our experience of music. Musical patterns that produce emotion and pleasure are replicated in a second, particularly extensive neural system-the motor system-and so emotion and pleasure arise in this second medium as well as in the direct experience of sound.” In essence, “…we use our bodies as resonators for auditory experiences.””

Right, that’s quite enough of that.

Assertiveness - the key to that distinct quality of assertiveness is the desire to maintain the relationship if at all possible. This isn’t a status battle, you want to allow this person to keep their dignity, you want to keep them onside. You’re the sun, not the wind.

First Christmas with your family - i.e Thamires, unborn Thiago and Zola. Lovely day with great pressies (you got Brazilian monopoly) and great food (you did your first full Christmas meal. First cup of tea and drink of wine for about 3 months went down a treat!

This is what it’s all about!

2022

Christmas at home in Donny with Oli’s family. Met Saffy for first time. Missing Dad. As Duke Ellington says: “a problem is a chance to do your best”. The problem you need to solve is how to find a wife, create the conditions to raise a family well, look after your mum and still have time to work on your purpose/projects (at 43).

Christmas in Lisbon. Nice walk with Mum in the morning - talked a bit about Dad at the end. Lunch reservation cancelled by restaurant so ended up at Jamie Oliver’s pizza place - rude waiter from São Paulo, not so good. Too much coffee and booze messing with the tolerance levels. 

Watched Klaus back at the flat. Fletchers are playing the Pretender, that was a nice round of Christmas pressies for the family.

Turns out the SME have decided to review all extracurricular activity in terms of COVID risk. Not looking good for us getting back into the schools this semester. Fátima being shrill and unhelpful.

A little peeved that I’m going to lose my e evening piano practice time with the return of the I seem to be doing more and more and get the feeling that if I had a chance I would just go fit it and do 8 hours straight.

2021

On the plane to Rio from Paris CDG. Finally made it! Just have to get the instruments through customs now. Traveling with Will Fastiggi which was actually better than being alone (you miserable git) although he doesn’t seem to have grasped that if the mask never actually comes within an inch of mouth and nose it’s effectiveness is somewhat reduced...

Will is quite seriously interested in Favela Brass. If he spoke Portuguese better he could be a good board member - maybe he could be a UK board member? Get the impression that he would be a good worker.

Had a caffeine fast till about 3 today and was really feeling it. Total existential angst! Then fell off the wagon completely and did 2 Starbucks double espressos before working through the 8 hour wait. Recording planned and important communications done, rhythm section parts for mamãe eu quero done, newsletter close to done. Quite fun doing the caffeine tension and release thing actually. Later morning tea?

Succumbed to the wine, coffee and even cognac “digestif” on the flight. Have to say, bliss. I would love for there to be an international element to the project where we end up visiting France. I would also love to learn French - which could also come in handy one day if you ever went to or worked with anyone from West Africa. A French housemate would be good one day (from a language perspective!)

Funny how the mental state colours everything - you can be fretting about it all one moment and marveling at it the next. A really good way to look at it is been “I love this” - i.e whatever it is, you love taking on the challenge, just giving it your best. Bring it on. You have to thrive on the difficulties, whatever they are, safe in the knowledge that the trickier the problem, the more satisfaction you’ll get from addressing it.

Paying for all that coffee drinking over the last 2 weeks today. Not good for very much and bed-bound in the afternoon when I should be at least going and buying stuff or washing clothes.

Another annoying micromanaging Bindu episode today as she wanted me to get us involved in morrinho’s grafite effort and then sends all sorts of messages about how I should be doing our social media. Oh shit. You have to post more and better and find other ways to give Bindu a voice.

Did get my arse in gear, went to the laundrette and practiced trumpet. The launderette was so cheap (£3 for the lot) and so nice to have clean clothes now. Stopped twice for beers with the crazy tamarind syrup with sesame seeds round the lip of the cup. Was taking a quick video of the street scene coming back when a friendly cyclist stopped and warned me to stop being a stupid tourist, basically. 

Still, nice end to a nice trip to Mexico City. A lot worse places to do 2 weeks of quarantine.

Thinking about the project, I think it should just expand outwards slowly. Just covering the city of Rio is enough to keep us busy for many years.

In the shit. Woke up with palpitations, and am stressed. Was zombified at the weekend with Thamires - not talkative, less energy. The fact that you’re back writing a long diary is indicative of the fact that all is not well. I think part of the cause is getting back onto stove-top coffee, and another part is a series of stressful situations at work.

1. Gabriel told you on Friday that PRIO aren’t going to give you any money in the first trimester. That means that Favela Brass will run out of cash in May. You didn’t get a contract from PRIO which makes you look amateurish. ACTION

1. In addition, Pat hasn’t been filling out the budget going forward, and now that we’re getting down to that it’s clear that we are overspending and action needs to be taken to make ends meet at the end of the year. ACTION

1. Sômulo is back to his old steamrollering ways, recently calling you negligent for not wanting to demand ticket registration fot the 10 years even. He is now vice-president and Norton treasurer - not ideal. NO ACTION

1. PECK productions want us to do bullshit oficinas at PRIO’s theatre at the end of May, which you will have to produce. ACTION

1. You have Taylor wanting to do a film about Favela Brass, which is great, but it locks you in, and locks you into creating a band with the ex-students that can go to New Orleans. 

1. Rafael has taken on an idea of yours to make badges for the benfeitoria donors, but he’s made them « friends of favela brass «  which I think is difficult because it implies that those who don’t donate aren’t friends of favela brass.

1. You forgot to send participating parts to 10 years bands. SORTED

1. Breno doesn’t have time to jazz up annual report at the moment.

1. You still haven’t read the 2022 prestação de contas.

2021

Angelo has not only stepped down as president but actually left the board. Told me last week and officially announced it yesterday in the board meeting.

It’s good and bad. Bad that we’re now light on directors, bad that it looks a bit like I can’t keep a president, bad that he’s not going to be making contacts for us. Bad also that you two ended up falling out to a certain extent.

It is good, however, that you now have the chance to find a president who will actually assume the role. Mirela said she wasn’t interested so let’s hope that Sômulo steps up.

Looking after yourself (less caffeine less booze more exercise etc.) makes you better socially. People have to want to work with you, want to be around you. You need to avoid those little mistakes like mentioning Norton in the last personal conversation with Angelo etc. 

—-

End of what, it has to be said, was a bit of a lazy day. Very pleasant green tea vibe. If you can just construct a routine to keep you working even in this more chilled state would be great.

Spent the morning thinking about the organization of the lessons and it did pay off - had the idea to put mangueirinha in the schools plus you and volunteers doing recorder and the fundamentals/melódica course on same day. You can open or close the tap in terms of how many new students you accept each term. Tailor to each school - basically just do your best for each group (some may even turn into school bands).

Nice idea of the individual schools being like rivers leading into the bay (of Guanabara). Also, coringa would be a good name for a music method.

Had a thought. What you’re doing is sorting out music Ed in Brazil. Not by imposing a big system, but by finding a formula that works here - the schools and social projects flowing into the oficina. The bloco, the percussion, the big band and especially the grade system. That is really something that could scale. Just listing tunes and keys for each grade would bypass copyright.

Doesn’t the name coringa fit in with this? The coringa can be played at any time, it stands for flexibility, adaptability, universality. The musical fundamentals are the same across genres, so the coringa can fit in whatever the music project. Tunes in any style can be graded. By inviting Brazil to use a grading system you are almost playing a wild card that seems like it’s nothing, but could have big consequences.

Got my head in the clouds thinking about getting a place in the vale do café. Binge watched the Fora em Juiz de Fora YouTube vídeos and been looking at houses in Miguel Pereira and Paty de Alfares. Heading up there on Saturday.

Escapism? Maybe, but there’s some solid logic there. Up in the hills would be a fantastic place to bring up kids. You could get a great place with space where you can record whenever. Airbnb would be an option with a bigger house. And fuck me wouldn’t it be nice to leave the favela behind?

Favela Brass’s remit is kids in the state schools and favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Question is: is that municipality or state? If it’s state then you can start a polo in the vale do cafe. Fazenda Brass!

Not having great days at the office. Put FOCA linha 1 in the wrong category, and got angry with Somulo at the end of the meeting. Bindu called to chew me out because she doesn’t think Rouanet is the way to go. Bindulo could be a nasty combination to deal with. For Christssake don’t turn everyone against you.

Listening to “mistakes were made, but not by me” book and it’s helping. You need to keep yourself on the hook, but then at some point let yourself off it. You also need to avoid just defending your opinion the whole time in general.

Have to say I’m struggling a bit with how Mum was with Dad at the end. He didn’t want to go to family camp, and he wasn’t well. We should have dropped everything and focused on him. She shouldn’t have been pushing you to go back, and there really wasn’t any need for her to go to see Oli’s family at the cottage.

What is it that you don’t like about all this? Not being there for your close family. The whole charity starts at home thing  - let’s help the refugees but not be there properly for Dad. In your defence, you tried to stop her taking him to family camp and you overruled her about you going back.

With board thing, bear in mind you fell out with Carola. Whatever you do, you will always have to deal with people.

Curry Clube Yesterday. Not many people showed up because of the Flamengo River Plate match on Saturday. Henri didn’t show up and Nathan only got there right at the end. Stern words needed. Turma 1 played well though - albeit with adult help.

Amelia just joined the project - nice player, takes photos with a super-expensive camera and seems generally cool - what’s not to like?

At the end of Curry Clube I got off with Ingrid and got my dick out for her to suck. Not a good move - she could easily blab that to Ariane who could blab it to the rest of the favela, including mothers. And if she doesn’t blab it now, she might do when she realises that she’s not priority #1 for you.

Another thing is that you were in a bad mood for curry clube. If you have to drink coffee that’s one thing, but at least do Hasfit to give you good energy.

Saturday kids played for Erick Ramalho’s crazy prog rock event at the British School. So glad to have that out of the way. The Masons donated R$3.500 and we managed to get a band together during the Flamengo match which was a minor miracle. Met Steve Rimmer as well which could be good for the project down the road.

Pretty sure this will be Dad’s last night. At least we managed to get him the drugs he needed to relax him (remember filming him and showing it to the nurse Michelle?). Just too tired to stay there all night.

Mum got me up for swimming this morning after I had a FB board meeting till midnight yesterday. Not amused. At the board meeting they approved R$5k for me. Great news!

Exhausted, sad and just a little bit angry from time to time. Need to meditate and build up that resistance to everything. Reading the curse of the self which is a revelation. It’s you - when you’re ruminating it’s you that’s doing it to yourself.

DAILY NUGGET - MONEY

The HSP book really nailed it with the point that supporting people of your type financially is a bad idea - they’ll head into the cave and never come out. Only by forcing them to make something that society will pay for are they dragged kicking and screaming into the real world. Don’t kid yourself that you won’t do this again. Engineer a situation where you need, and are able, to make money with your work.

2023

Watching stand-up comedy on Youtube. Dara O’Briain, Ricky Gervais etc. This is good for you - a lot less creepy than watching Robert Greene for a start. Interviewing for new manager at Favela Brass which is exciting but you’re stressing a bit about getting the format right and having to let candidates down. Camila didn’t show up for the meeting today or answer messages, and Rúbia sent a draft of a press release which wasn’t earth shattering. Think you’re going to have to get someone in mate. You need to get the right people on the bus etc.

Sent a message to Thamires. Why didn’t you just chill the hell out and go with her? Very interesting that research saying that by far the biggest predictor of your satisfaction with a relationship is who you are, and not the person you marry. What’s the lesson?: that feeling that you have in this relationship, it’ll be the same in the next, the next and the next. As Kenny said: it’s you - that whole « I’m not feeling what I’m supposed to be feeling » - that’s just down to you, you feckin’ eedjut. The only solid thing as well is that people are miserable on their own. Get on with it you gaylord.

Hit the ground running in Rio with this carnival recording putting the pressure on. Don’t know if it was the Starbucks espresso hangover but I was worried by yesterday’s board meeting - the one where Angelo decided to go off on one saying we should be able to route our benfeitoria donations to Rouanet. The issue of new directors was totally unresolved and then we randomly ended up with a strategy meeting next Monday. 

The board can amble on like this but I think we need more members a) so we can have a governance and events committee b) take pressure off existing board members c) get important culture person, board experience person, Bcs person, events person on board and d) widen our net for captação and donations 

Amélia did haggis for burns night yesterday and I did a curry today. Find a way to get Joe involved, give him a way out. 

In the morning ran up past ceat and practiced trumpet at the viewing spot before running back listening to music. Very nice! Round about 5pm energy levels dipped but later on got some little bits of work done and did quite a bit of piano practice - loving the bergmuller stuff today.

Engenho do Mato with Thamires again this weekend. So happy to be with her - you make her happy, that’s some kind of a miracle. Chatted about kids indirectly at Itaipu at sunset and it seems like she might be up for it. Renata the Airbnb host took us to look at a house and a plot of land. The idea of building a house there is very tempting. Just short of cash - you have R$350.000 pending a few more payments, but R$26.000 is tied up in the previdência. You also have a house in Pereira da Silva, but selling that would deprive you of a decent income - even if you just rent it long-term.

To do the building project must be R$450.000 in the end, so even with the money from the British School you’d still be short to the tune of around R$100.000

Well… not the best journey ever. Having thrown my Mexican Visa card stub away when I arrived, I ended up having to pay 600 pesos and rushing around like a crazy person to get on the NY flight today. Just as it looked like everything was going ok I realized on arriving in NY that my Brazilian ID card must have fallen out of the pocket on the flight.

Up until that point I had been just about managing the despair building up as a result of suddenly dropping from 3-coffees a day in Mexico City (silly boy!) to nowt. This, coupled with an unintentional 24-hour fast made for some fairly tasty emotions getting in to the Airbnb in Brooklyn.

However 1 Brooklyn pizza, 2 bowlfuls of Raisin Bran, 1 shower and 1 Next Coast IPA  later and things are a lot more bearable.

Thinking about projects for next year and looks like ISS for a school in zona norte, rouanet for other schools (but include possibility of a school in zona norte), and a project in your CNPJ for the amigos da Cacilda in Rouanet.

The new house is fantastic, and hopefully before too long it will be a family home. You need to get out of commitments in Rio. Way to do this: you write the projects and do the coordenação geral/direção artística. Someone else takes the bands. Maybe Wesley Banda 1, Joe the amigos da Cacilda.

DAILY NUGGET

**Go for the prestige strategy over the dominance strategy.**

This comes from Will Stoor’s AOM interview about his book The Status Game. The idea is that the general tendency is to default too much to the dominance strategy when challenged, trying to establish your superior status to the person in that situation. If, however, you try to find opportunities to give other people status and prestige wherever possible, you will find that status flowing back to you. 

*“. . . we all too easily slip into dominance, and you know, these little acts of dominance that mark our days you know, when we kind of roll our eyes, send rude emails when we feel that we’ve been slighted. And it’s a much better strategy, I think, to try and use these small moments of prestige, try to make people feel good as much as possible, even though in the short term we might not get our way. Because people love status, if you get a reputation as somebody that is generous with your status, and makes people feel good about themselves, people are gonna wanna be with you, and you’re gonna get lots of status coming back your way. So I think it’s very easy, and it’s in our kind of animal nature, our pre-human nature, to push back with dominance all the time. But I think to mindfully go to prestige is a really useful thing."*

Oli’s clan still over. Walk, games, mulled wine etc. Still up on the air about PRIO deposits. 

2021

Belém with Mum, Val and Hardy. The monastery was inspiring, the weather less so. Missed the offer on the MacBook Air in FNAC. Nice restaurant meal later on at the place that did Portuguese-style cachaça but got hit with a 222 euro bill. Drank a lot - will be feeling that today no doubt.

2020 - COVID Christmas with Mum and Dad. I was on barbecue duty doing the pigs in blankets and chipolatas. I finished up on Christmas Eve at 5pm then hid from the phone for 24 hours. Highly recommended - need to get this thing in check, have slots for checking the phone then put it out of reach. Nice game of slightly drunk scrabble in the evening which Dad won.

Finished The Weeknd Blinding Lights arrangement and vídeo today. Pretty happy all told. Video is a bit indulgent I guess but I do think you have to be realistic: writing big band arrangements for some future hypothetical band is not the same thing as writing them so you can make a YouTube vid where it will get listened to and seen.

These arrangements are a thing unto themselves: whatever happens at Favela Brass they are their own achievement and a concrete contribution to the cause. If you keep pumping them out good things will come of this. For a start, it’s a musical mission statement: this is where we want Favela Brass to get to. They also open the door to exchanges and are an excellent calling card for yours truly.

Let these arrangements be your artistic escape from the draining politics of being director of favela brass. This and the piano is your “you” time. Pay yourself first. 

Have been running in the mornings which is the key to feeling human.

Carnaval bloco was great fun yesterday. Took the Eb tuba. Some nice moments early on playing sambas in the street with cavaquinho and sax. The thing went and went and went home about half 8 at night after it had well and truly turned into a crack.

Should have chatted to the cute girl with braids. How many opportunities like this have you missed over the years?

2021

Had a cracking week. 4 good tweaks:

1. Fasting from lunchtime to breakfast on weekdays
2. Getting up bang on 5 and cycling every morning
3. Having a coffee and doing a 90-min deep work session on the syllabus first thing.
4. Moving the meeze and main trumpet practice to after 5pm

Fasting has contributed to better sleep and weight loss. Getting up at 5 has also helped on the sleep front (and productivity). The 90-min morning deep work means that every day, no matter how bogged down you get with admin, you can look back and know that the course has improved - you made a deposit in the savings account. The meeze and trumpet in the evening is great because the morning time is exchanged for deep work time and you spend the evening in “cleaning mode”, getting the next day organized so you can relax.

Went out for pizza and beer with only Amelia last night which was nice but drank just a bit too much (1 bottle colorado, 2 cans Bohemia) and didn’t drink water and as a result had a crap night’s sleep. Really not fun. Alternate sparkling water with beer so you at least avoid the beginnings of a hangover.

On Thursday participated in the Ekloos course which was, all told, worth it. Lots of little ideas like surveys to get data for the composition of Carnival blocos and feedback from the parents, sticking to guns about focusing on music. Would be great if they could work with us for our strategic planning - could save a whole lot of belly-gazing.

2021 (2)

Bit of a low point later on. At pizzaria for Suellen and Antonio’s chá de revelação, and Marcia got drunk. Came out with “Joe come mais devagar que o Tom, é mais legal.” 

This is what you get for shagging Ingrid. That was a very bad move - her and Marcia are the least discrete people you know. You can also tell that they have rubbed various people up the wrong way. You don’t want to be associated with them and shagging Ingrid takes you down various pegs.

There’s not a lot to do now. They will always come to the parties or curry club if you have it. Good thing is you have that moment when you shagged Natalia at Marcia’s place as a reference - that feeling of “you know what? Fuck it, I don’t care”.

The first lesson is not to shit where you eat. Ever. The other is to work on the PE and move your network forward. Find the silver lining. Onwards and upwards. What good could come of this?

DAILY NUGGET - Mastery

You long to create your niche. To find the little thing that you excel at, and are continually honing. The idea of being a back-office boffin, who just potters around in his cave inventing creative gismos that help everyone else - the code-breaker. One danger in this is that you end up presiding over a crazy, ever-changing method that doesn’t get used - just as you presided over a crazy ever-changing set of big band arrangements that didn’t get used. The other danger is that you end up in a position that doesn’t suit your nature - spending the whole time dealing with people, power politics, harsh criticism, management, meetings and a crushing volume of administrative details all at the same time.

How to carve that niche? 

Same role within Favela Brass: For this you would have to delegate everything non-music related. Have staff that handle pretty much everything except the music side. You just make sure everyone is paid, keep the board happy and take the first few hours of the day to work on the method. This requires you finding good staff. 

Another role within Favela Brass: For this you would need to point Favela Brass in the right direction, get the board on the same page, put in an Executive Director who won’t go off the tracks (Cris?), and then put yourself in a position where they can’t do without you. Diretor Artístico/Pedagógico. It’s risky because the others could make decisions that make you want to leave.

Outside Favela Brass: For this you would want to point FB in the right direction then get out completely. Take your CV elsewhere, or set your own little self-employed business up. You could do a lucrative school for rich students, adult students, our your could find some way to sell your method books.

*"Your skill level will reach a point where you will be able to claim your independence from within the group you work for and move out on your own. In a world in which there is so much we cannot control, this will bring you the ultimate form of power. You will determine your circumstances. As your own Master, you will no longer be subject to the whims of tyrannical bosses or scheming peers.”*

Yesterday was a bit of a write-off. So much to do but just couldn’t think. Did eventually manage to define the lessons in Pereira which was the most difficult bit. Really do hate having so many things on the radar at once. Looked at house prices in Santa Teresa - if you got somewhere with a spare room or two for Airbnb it could be a good investment. Went to Mustafa’s to record trombone then realized I wasn’t going to get anywhere near it. Stressed at the moment, not the worst time, but not the best. Just feels like it’s all piling up. Had that dream where Dad was with us, you tried to take a photo and then woke up.

Watched the film “Living” last night, about an old bureaucrat in London in the 1950s who discovers he has cancer and decides to start living his life more.

As he reflects on his life, the main character says that all he wanted to be was a gentleman when he was younger. To be one of those men in suits and bowler hats that got on the train to London and made the crust for their family. That was the model of your Dad’s generation, and it was his model for you. You’re now both more and less than that, but the point is that if you’re looking at a reference for how to live your life, how to be the kind of person that you admire, then you already have a reference from inside your own culture. The book “Infantalized” describes how this vision has died and now everyone learns they should follow their dream and let it all hang out.

You’re going to going to be a father in 3 months’ time. If ever there was a time to grow up, this is it. You’re never going to be Marcus Aurelius, but maybe you could work a bit more on being a gentleman in the day-to-day?

Isn’t there also a paradox in trying to be a gentleman, like there is a paradox in trying to be happy? Happiness isn’t found in trying to be happy: it is found in living well. Similarly, if your objective is for you, personally, to be the perfect gentleman, then maybe you’ll miss the overall point, which is about how you treat other people. Isn’t that also the essence of growing up - shifting the focus away from me me me?

Favela Brass not in a great place with the whole Cris x Camila x Raissa dynamic. Crappy office politics. Lessons going well apart from Rafa who is sulking the whole time in rehearsals. Yesterday morning worked out the syllabus system: just EE, abrsm scales and band arrangements. Much more practical!

2021

Been a long week. We ended up taking Dad to family camp which basically freaked him out, and you took him back with Mum on Saturday then returned Sunday morning. Nice walk with fletchers and barbecue then things went a bit strange.

Wendy’s Rob kept pouring you out sherry despite you declining, after you had decided to call it a night so you got a little bit tipsy. Then you ended up talking about the crazy stuff you did as a teenager and swearing with Charlotte and Rob.

You woke up in the middle of the night panicking that Oli’s kids heard you and that Charlotte and Rob were appalled and that you had ruined family camp, and basically had very little sleep just ruminating and worrying about what a twat you are, thinking about what vows you could take to make it right (one year no beer etc.)

Up the next morning to face the music and nobody batted an eyelid. A textbook example of you getting yourself worked up over nothing. That said… maybe you SHOULD get back on the path of the red card again. You need all the energy you can get.

Anyway, when we came back on Monday with Oli and family Dad first said he was feeling bad, then asked to be taken to bed, then started to get worse and we called an ambulance. Dad was saying his last goodbyes (“you take care of yourselves”) and Oli had to ask Louise to take the kids to town fields.

When the ambulance crew came they did their tests and established that Dad was basically stable, but thought he might have an infection. They got us through to the GP who proscribed antibiotics and Dad came round. He’s now slid back a bit into the depression because the antibiotics haven’t sorted a lot of his problems out (hopefully yet).

I was pretty destroyed energy-wise this evening and I still think some kind of drinking vow is coming on. Just read that “binge drinking in midlife is associated with increased risk of dementia.” Binge drinkers being defined as people who drink more than the equivalent of a bottle of wine in one sitting once a month. Your body will go on and on, it’s the brain you should worry about.

ICMS is very behind which makes it unlikely we’ll have it in time for Petrobras. You’re not having a holiday from Favela Brass that’s for certain. It just doesn’t stop.

Feeling absolutely fine. That’s it confirmed: you have one bad day after stopping caffeine then you’re pretty much ok. 

Ran to prospect park in the morning and then had a lovely walk around it, listening to the laws of human nature. Had a bit of a run around trying to get a COVID test but ended up getting it for free at a walk in place. Well, the amazingly beautiful girl who was working there said that the government are coughing up for uninsured cases and I didn’t sign anything, so I’m not going to think about it too much.

Nearly got a moderna vaccine at Walgreens. Will go back tomorrow at 8am.

Must have been a slow day in recent years!

Watched Scorsese’s The Departed and had a realization: you live your life feeling guilty. That you’re not working hard enough for the team, that you’re not a good enough leader, that you’re not getting enough done. [but also that you’re not a good person]

The morning when you had the dream and wrote the red letter. That was to do with this. About turning a corner and realizing that you can be a good person, and hold your head high. Not a perfect person. Just a good person. More important than anything.

And it does have to do with no caffeine and booze. Because then you start to become that person. Not the bad guy waiting to be found out, but the good guy with nothing to hide.

More bad news on the funding front: out of nowhere the SMC have taken the Fomento à Cultura grant away from us, based on the fact that our CNPJ has been going less than a year. The text of the rules that they sent only states that the project has to have been culturally active for a year and I have sent an email to try and protest. Seems like a wrong decision.

Worried that Kayla looks younger than she is. Took her to abcd that time and almost certainly people will be talking. She put 24 on the profile, is 23, but looks 20. It just brings back up things that we want to fade into the past. Have to be careful with this.

Finance meeting went ok last night. Finances are another story....

Met with Sandra at Azur yesterday before gig. Feel better about having her as a trustee now. No issues with Carola not being on board. Feeling better about this aspect. Carola liked hearing that I want to pay her more for handling Rouanet admin. The question is whether she will accept just handling the admin side of things.

British School was particularly bad. Monica and Rafael let the kids do anything it seems. I leave to wash mouthpieces and when I come back the kids are shouting football songs while Rafael is on his cel phone in the corner. Need to get out of this ridiculous situation.

Still missing Talita. Joy seemed cool but looks like she’s a “my way or the highway” type, Hinali is fantastic but maybe a little crazy/needy.

How to mark Dad’s passing? Hard to spend a day in silence when you’ve got lessons and a show with 30 kids. Remember him. And remember your promise to him.

The meaning of life? Your parents look after you and give you a life, and you do the same for your kids. There’s nothing more adaptive than that. Imagine cooking barbecue for your kids one day. Or teaching them cornet. Damn.

Today was the day. He’s gone. Hard to know what to say. It’s a lot to take in.

Got through the tired, slightly hungover day yesterday and will be able to finish the Recorder Karate course today. Started listening to the 4dx book which is definitely food for thought. How can we get that feeling of “game on” with the project? Your 200 students plan is solid and specific but it needs to be time-bound as well. Yearly quotas would bring this closer to the present. The online aspect gives us an infinite window which perhaps could also be inspiring - but difficult to make concrete goals.

The question “if everything else stayed the same in your business, what one improvement would make the most difference?” is also a corker. I think it’s having an online curriculum. Multiplies your impact in terms of kids using the materials, but also allows you to multiply your impact by having teachers come in and easily follow the curriculum, and it also opens the door to having other people using our stuff and getting to know the project that way. When you get back, the percussion courses with Mangueirinha are a priority.

Hired Viviane yesterday and also roped her into organising the communications calendar. Meeting with Sherlock went well - hopefully we’ll still have plenty of support from them on a more strategic level. Let Mariane and Patrícia know which was especially hard in the case of Mariana, because she so clearly wants to work with us and help. Would be great to have her as produtora to go with Vivi as produtora executiva, but we’ll have to work up to that.

Helayne come to clean and you forget that you left viagra out. How embarrassing. Joe has COVID. New airbnb guest David arrived. Guests so far have been giving you 5-stars overall but 3 for cleanliness. Aside from organising the kitchen better, I think the priority is a new bathroom. Given the level of demand you’re seeing, surely this will pay off long-term. Bought air con in the afternoon for the practice room which seems extravagant, but I think is important for getting Joe using it. Thinking on the lines of doing up the upstairs room as well, starting with the roof, which would give a high rental-value room upstairs if needed, and a better place for you to stay for now.

Pereira is getting more and more touristy, so the investment should have a decent payoff. Tricky aspect is Joe occupying the main room for low rent, and Amelia wanting to come back. Maybe just a rent hike would be a middle way.

After the lessons had the mothers meeting up at the Assunção, which wasn’t too bad in terms of the main part. But Soraya brought her autistic daughter and set her free, which brought the meeting to a standstill. When you basically waited for her to sort the situation she took her daughter home in a huff and proceeded to put a « textão » in the group. The worst part of this though is Patrícia, Bento’s Mum, who wrote a very political message in the group and is clearly going to be a thorn in our side. I now have to explain to the board why she won’t be a director.

Cris doesn’t present a united front in the meetings - it’s all « Eu ainda não falei isso para Tom, mas eu acho que temos que ter isso ». You stood on different sides of the room, which made you look disunited. She didn’t send the attendance cards to all of the Mums, maybe this is something to give to Raissa so it actually gets done. But she speaks to the parents well, and is happy to take on that part. And she’s not a raving lefty loon, which most coordenadores pedagógicas would be (imagine working with Patrícia).

Decided to give up booze for lent, but not sure whether I should have gone whole hog and given up caffeine as well.

“
Messed up yesterday. Went out playing in the blocos and drinking during the day. Was great but drank too much (we’re talking a good 4-5 pints) and didn’t stop soon enough. Did the Favela Brass gig at Axls which was fine but let things slip that you wouldn’t usually. 

The part that could cause problems is that you didn’t send everyone home on time. Ended up with the kids chilling out together at Mazinho’s. Artu was up the road playing with Rian and his dad ended up coming to pick him up just at the wrong moment when he was actually inside the party.

You didn’t think that anyone would notice but Claudio commented that you stayed in the same place outside Mazinho’s for half an hour - maybe this gave you away to him. At best it was sloppy, at worst reckless.

These people are trusting you with their kids. You are responsible for your students. You must never be under the influence at a time when you are supervising the kids again.

Let’s hope you got away with it, but it’s tricky: Ivan saw you heading to Carnaval, people will have seen you coming back half cut at 3. People know you and they will have noticed the difference in you later on. 

This could come out in the future in various forms and it serves as a warning - you must keep Manguerinha’s postura in mind. Nobody sees you on the corner drinking, you keep the kids away from alcohol. The older students don’t drink around our events. 

Reputation is everything and if you’re working with kids part of the reputation needs to be that you are highly responsible. The think you need to keep front and center is that one slip can ruin years of good work. 

Remember Silvia when you went to buy açaí - not the usual friendly reaction. Wagner passing by while you were sitting on the pavement. Same thing. Drunks sit on the pavement. Andre was looking at you very carefully during the performance. Also during the performance everyone was watching you and you didn’t do the normal announcing bit.

Just you going out dressed up to Carnival every day at the moment has the potential to cause problems. Also shagging Monique with the windows open.

You may find you have your work cut out now. But we are where we are so what can be done now?

Not drinking is a possibility. Maybe try a break up to the next Carnaval. A reputation for being teetotal will help you, as will the extra time and energy.

Long term, living outside the favela could help. Less gossip.

Don’t let over 18 students drink around Favela Brass events.

“Much that passes as idealism is disguised love of power” 
- Bertrand Russell

Lovely little quote from the start of Borgen - which must be one of the best series you’ve ever seen. Sunday night with a whisky watching Borgen is part of the maintenance program for now.

This (Sunday) morning at Aterro do Flamengo went great. 13 kids. Only thing is that these kids are generally light-skinned - I.e. you’re not getting to the really poor favela kids. But the location is ideal from a lot of perspectives. 

Missed an opportunity for the correct power play at lunch with Marcia and Ingrid. You should have acted as if nothing happened but instead you were aloof with them. That may be more genuine but now they know they can get to you and both have enormous mouths. Don’t shit where you sleep, ever.

Here’s an idea that would be very cool if you stuck to it: **every year launch a new brass band in Rio**. That way you wouldn’t have to keep students in Favela Brass till they are 21: as soon as they hit 18 they will have a band to go to. Ties in with the 8 at grade 8 planning.

Students could even start rehearsing with the pro bands before they turn 18. As these bands stack up, they form the roster for your Brassify events. Maybe even designate a leader/producer student who will find gigs for the band etc.

“Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts”
- Churchill

Borgen can always be relied on for a good quote. Very glad that I’m rationing these episodes to one a week - don’t want it to end. Can’t put my finger on why I enjoy it so much.

How can I sum up the present moment? Worried about COVID, about getting and spreading it - Brazil is starting to really lose control and 6% of deaths with the new variant are younger than you. Went for a pizza at Hedi’s on Saturday and you and Joe both regretted it. That’s off the menu now (pardon the pun). Lessons are suspended at the convent and the aterro and I’m not in any hurry to start back. It’s more serious now.

Today is Sunday but turned it into a Deep Work day. Just had a week on Green Tea only which was a little on the unproductive side, but really helped to recharge the batteries. Had a jar of black tea today and I was off - finished the first “Technical Comprehension” book today and very proud of it. Really excited that it hits the harder to reach fundamentals of musical understanding in a way that other music teachers can fairly easily teach. No two-week training courses or any of that rubbish.

I like the idea of reversing the dynamic: rather than trying to have weekends off coffee, why not have just weekends on coffee? That way you don’t get addicted. Just have to deal with a caffeine hangover rather than caffeine withdrawal and while you are doing that you have two full days of solid Deep Work to look forward to. Two (or even one) caffeinated deep work days would be awesome and you could spend the rest of the time pottering knowing the DW will get done. Less switching.

That said, on green tea last week I solved a lot of big-picture problems. Had the fitas de Bomfim idea, worked out the structure for the lessons when we go back, etc. It’s like a lens - if you want to zoom out, green tea and little caffeine, if you want to zoom in, black tea/coffee (black tea is fine).

Date with Luana Friday (aterro do Flamengo). Great girl, unfortunately her having 3 kids limits it a bit.

At the board meeting last week they were busy congratulating themselves on the great finances last year. But the reality is that sound finances for the project were paid for out of your finances. Where’s this going? At some point, you have to land this plane.

Looking at the above at 1 in the morning after a bunch of whisky, I can’t help thinking it all sounds just a bit petty and boring.

Stressful week. Had the whole thing about the board voting on the FOCA project issue, but not just that. Maria Rita’s mum and Geiza being dicks and saying their kids won’t go on trips because they can’t go. And now Cris getting upset at my criticisms of her at the Blues Festival.

What to do? I guess get the caffeine down - at least switch to tea. You’re stressed, feeling like you just need to be unwired for a bit. That’s coffee (as well as circumstances). You need that even keel, that extra bit of self control in the tank before saying something hurtful. We need good Tom back.

You know the drill, loads of exercise, meditate every day, no booze or caffeine, don’t overeat.

Board meeting last night which had very little in the way of discussion. We’re gearing up for the strategy meeting on Saturday. After showing signs of reasonableness Bindu started questioning whether I have the right skillset for musical director or whether we shouldn’t get someone else. One of the big risks here is that Bindu and Sômulo start trying to bulldoze the new Executive Director. Need more directors, make that list now.

In terms of mission, I’m thinking that as I leave I could point to 3 things that would make an activity not Favela Brass:

1. WHAT. Departing from Brass Band and Bloco set-up and our mix of pop, MPB and jazz/second line (or giving in to people asking us to teach other things).

Why? The project is intended to put kids from lower incomes at the head of this whole brass band movement thing. It’s not just about music, it’s about popular brass band street music - the music that has a chance of keeping live music as part of popular music culture.

1. WHO. Giving lessons to rich kids as defined as private school, or to adults.

Why? We won’t solve the problem of an elite Carnaval by teaching rich kids. If they pay it’s worse because the demanding parents will pull the focus away from the favela kids. A project for rich kids or adults raising money for Favela Brass would be great, but let them organize that with the benefit of their own cash and connections.

1. WHERE. Managing projects outside Rio de Janeiro.

Why? Rio de Janeiro is the most important place in the world for live music but poorer kids don’t get a look in. Rio is the place where the street band culture and grass roots education gap is extreme - that is the problem we are trying to fix. Operationally, all of RJ state is a bus ride which makes for much stronger exchange possibilities. Without RJ state we lose these possibilities. Train partner projects around the world like Fight for Peace, but don’t actively manage them. Loose franchise. Friends of Favela Brass.

1. HOW. Abandoning grade system and long term approach. 1-year projects without evaluation.

Why? The project is about excellence. Not just poor kids learning music, but poor kids raising the bar in Rio de Janeiro. It’s a local authority music service, not a social project.

Told Cris I’m moving over and she said “I’m yours - do with me what you will!”. We could do a lot worse than sticking her in as DE.

2021

Curitiba. Went to the wrong airport. R$1100 down the drain. Dorcas was kind of depressing - these social projects are such a band aid. Did your coloured scale reference with the kids which was the wrong thing to do, but it’s a great tool and a great way to learn music.

Had the idea on the plane to do grades just based on scales and rhythm reading. As your Dad said - HOLD THAT THOUGHT! 

Afternoon tea with Ragnilde and her dinosaur eggs and beers at Tio Ali’s house - really good guy, enjoyed the chat about Brazilian music. Ed’s a great guy and can teach you a lot. Exchange trip off though as he’s in Trancoso Jan, things have soured with the Antonina núcleo, the hotel isn’t available off peak, and Curitiba in geral isn’t that impressive for the kids.

2020

What started out pretty inauspiciously turned into quite a productive day. Notching down from black to green tea at the moment and shortly after starting work arranging lindo lago de amor I just hit a wall of fatigue and ended up lying down. Did end up finishing the arrangement, but late.

Then just hit the bitty admin stuff, including starting the process moving for us having exams in January, completing old MEI declarations and later paying MEI payments down at the bank. Did recording for Luiz Henrique and was nice to put a little money in my pocket.

Finished the making of a chef which was a better book than I thought it would be and held your attention very well for some reason. Now moved on to devil in the kitchen which is promising to be even better.

2019

Busy weekend with the kids. Saturday morning music centre at CIEP went very well. Only 12 kids for 5 teachers but it went really well and CIEP let us uses the quadra 8am - 12am. Cacilda rehearsal afterwards went well and the whole format seemed to make a lot of sense. Now we need to think about how to get Favela Brass kids there (from the favelas).

Shows at Largo do Machado and Fluminense football club went well as well. Maria Rita and Maria Fernanda absent as well as Samuel Ribeiro. Felt a bit light numbers-wise.

Spent Sunday morning putting together shared GTD lists for me Carola & Joe. Realizing that Carola wasn’t doing much of the stuff that production should be helping with - communicating with parents, posting on Facebook/Instagram, helping at shows, editing videos. Instead you’re doing a lot of the production stuff while she defines the project.

The challenge now is to find time for your tasks both as Musical and Executive Director. Wouldn’t it be nice not to have to do Tuesdays and Thursdays at TBS?

Decent day’s admin work (lot of time on the site) and first bike ride all the way over the top since I got back. Two cups of tea got me working well all day but by 7:30 it’s game over. Touch and go if I’ll even get the trumpet practice done.

Yesterday and Sunday did the hotel thing with Monique at HDR. Bloody brilliant! She is hot as hell and viagra worked a treat. Would be amazing if you could push it to 2 days, but logístics difficult. Hmmm but you can work online Thursday to Saturday at the mo (and on buses to places if you get organized). Worth thinking about.

Miss Piauí has disappeared. Got a better offer by the sounds of it. Not really a big deal - she was hard work anyway. Never nice to have someone suddenly disappear on you though. But then you weren’t exactly going to great lengths to find cool stuff to do together. Only thing is that I did want to see her ass while I was fucking her from behind. Oh well...

Had a couple of glasses of wine tonight. Nice mellow vibe for listening to music. Amongst other things listened to Elizeth Cardoso’s canção de um amor demais. What a record! And what great orchestrations by a 31 year-old Tom Jobim. Could do worse than transcribe the whole thing.

Working on theory videos this morning and came up with a nice midi piano-roll type way of representing rhythms. Really happy with the way it’s going.

Thamires came home ill from work yesterday and you cancelled lessons to stay in and look after her. Perhaps the stress of the building work being behind time (with baby arriving shortly) is partly to do with Thamires getting ill.

Definitely got the too much to do feeling at the moment as the extra factors of building work and this 10-years video are added into the mix. Imagine what it’s going to be like when the baby comes!

Thinking about Taylor’s film. The big question: why is this interesting?

2023

Went to Glória market, cooked up a load of lentil curry, finally took the photos of the house and stuck it on Airbnb (Amelia moved out a few days ago to do the ships).

Got that sinking feeling about getting back to work tomorrow. Not sure I remember having this - the dread of facing everything that you have to get done tomorrow. All the sticky decisions, difficult people. Not wanting to turn in tonight and bring the weekend to an end. Just do your best, do your job, make the best decisions that you can. Then get on to the music side of things at FB - let someone else take the heat who thrives off that kind of thing.

About last year’s diary. Yes it’s the antagonism, maybe more specifically demeaning other people - not necessarily getting all up in other people’s faces, but just not giving them proper respect. According to the BEST model in *Hire with you Head *that’s the danger with technicians and it rings true for you.

2022

DAILY NUGGET - Your antagonism = Their disloyalty

The one trait that will give you the most trouble is you antagonism. Popularity is power. Think of it like a network - a person who is on your side is a green node, a person who isn’t is a red node. Every short-tempered interaction invites a red node. Every time you slag someone off and they find out about it you’re creating a contagious red node. People want to be around people who are creating green nodes for them, and will try to create other red nodes for their own red nodes. Compound interest. See the Antagonism x Loyalty spreadsheet, and BE NICE TO PEOPLE.

Ah, and here’s the key thing: you don’t have to be being antagonistic toward the person in question to turn them off. The more you’re slagging other people off to them, the more they’re going to start to think that you’re an antagonistic person, the more they are going to start to take other people’s sides, and the more they are going to distance themselves from you.

If you believe the psycho-babble then as an INFJ you are likely to judge others, to criticise them and to slam the door on them psychologically. That’s an awful lot of red nodes right there.

So the idea that clicked when you were listening to Robert Greene in prospect park yesterday is this: Queen Elizabeth sensed that as a woman she was in a precarious position, so she didn’t lead by force and coercion, rather her vulnerability lead her to a smarter style of leadership.

You are now a bit compromised. So you can’t stick your chest out and lord it over everyone. Maybe that’s a good way to think about it. You have to think twice now about pissing everyone off, you need people to really genuinely like the way you lead.

Other thing from Robert Greene was the whole “He who has a why, can bear with almost any how” thing. I.e. it’s not about building yourself a lifestyle, it’s about following your mission. Favela kids getting good at playing brass instruments in Rio de Janeiro.

Another thing, don’t forget that experience walking through the PATH train terminal at the World Trade Center. Just the whole thing of it being so beautiful, so well designed - people walking around on the floor above and then walking down to the platform. There’s something in there.

Horrendous lesson at Ciep yesterday. Cock ups with the register just threw it all off. Must must tighten the admin up before you lose all your students and a good portion of your instruments.

Funny how so many of your old diaries are about your routine. 

Took herpes test today let’s see. Monique is taking as well. She commented today that I don’t make long term plans with her. Which is true. Can’t help feeling she’s justa bit crazy.

Still having regular dreams where Dad is alive.

2021

Slightly hungover day yesterday but at least created the 10 years vídeo for the upcoming otimismo planetario conference. Lovely seeing the early videos and the progression of the kids.

Toying with the idea of a 3+3+1 day cycle of business/program/curriculum x 2 then rest day Sunday. The criteria between business/program is asking “is this item contributing more directly to the day-to-day workings of the project or the business model that provides it with resources.”

Gives you a full-day run at whatever it is and a “day off” on Sunday (after the lessons, of course). This also gives you a night out on Saturday and a night in on Sunday.

Wednesday and Saturdays could be the deep-work (preferably green) tea days that you look forward to - your non-time “maker time” as opposed to the other days of “manager time”.

Just a little bit annoyed at Amelia’s COVID attitude - she’s off traveling and is basically in two others bubbles with Alison, Flor and Fabio. And us. This time really exposes the selfishness of people and the excuses that they use to cover it. She proclaims in saintly manner that she “wouldn’t judge anyone at this time” - which is a wonderful way of taking the moral high ground while fucking others over. 6% of deaths under 40 now.

Did a bike ride over the top yesterday and pretty much everything that could go wrong with the bike did go wrong. New rule: if the bike isn’t 100% you don’t ride it. This could save your life. Get a helmet, lights, a high-vis and a bell, dickhead. Legs absolutely destroyed at the end but still managed piano and trumpet practice at the end - well done me!

Raining incessantly so stuck at home all day. After the high of São Paulo, a genuinely tough patch with the whole Rafael and Lucia situation and the realization that there’s a minority of Mums intent on making your life hell.

Got a bit of time at the end of today though and watched Robert Greene and Jordan Peterson. Interesting the idea of using/needing anger to get work done and also the idea of fearless from contemplation of or close experiences with death.

You feel death in your bones now. You can feel the water rising. It’s different now. Could the silver lining be a bit less fear?

Still don’t feel like I can trust Cris 

2021

Still not feeling right about Dad. You can’t remember him without thinking of that one day. I’m cross with mum that’s for sure - family camp, telling me to go back, planning the funeral before he had even died. And more so with me. Tried talking to him today and that seemed to help.

Started memorizing Shakespeare in the morning. That could become a family tradition, a bit of Dad you could pass on. It just points to how important social skills are, and etiquette. So many things were just plain handled badly. 

Long day and got lots done. Bindu is nagging Mirela now. Oh god what have I done?

Booked to go to Curitiba end of October.

2020 (1)

Back on track. Have replaced coffee with green tea and have been running and meditating in the mornings. Much better.

On Sunday went to that amazing lake in the middle of nowhere with Adrienne to feed the fishes, then to the Orla Por do Sol. Really lovely day.

Yesterday spoke to Mangueirinha’s contact, Fatima, about her writing our grants. She seems really switched on an upbeat. Let’s hope we can afford her. Turns out Rouanet is limited to R$200.000 in the first year.

Starting to think that delegation is where it is at. Can you get someone to handle the communications as well? Or what if you had a secretary / “administrative coordinator”?

Win today. The past is what it is, the future is what it will be. Just ask yourself - “Did I win today?” and that’s enough.

A lot on the plate. Board making a million comments on the PRIO contract, need to sort a new ED/manager, hire a bunch of staff for March, get kids ready for Xmas show and exams, sort out contrapartida in time. And a bunch of other stuff. Never has just dealing with the music been more appealing.

Realized that with the board, the tendency will always be for creep - whether it’s mission creep, funding creep or just plain empire building. They want to see the project grow under them. Have to think how to get them interested in quality. Focus on exam grades?

Upset Cris at the blues festival gig in Lagoa. One too many digs. You also were pretty robust with Hedi for not giving the kids enough pizza (again) on Friday. You’re under stress, it’s a hard job, but don’t take it out on others or, as the old man said, you’ll end up losing all your friends. 

2021

Amid this difficult time a lovely moment. Split the groups into Pereira / FF now and today was Pereira’s day. Putting up gazebos with Marquinho and Samuel felt like camping. Then the lesson with pereira working through new group technical lesson and rote lesson (with new warmup patterns) went really well. I found myself being nice to the students, cracking the odd joke and them appreciating it. This is what you like doing. Preparing lessons and teaching them to your kids. Your kids.

Then Marquinho finished his lesson with Edileuza, gave her a nível 1 percussion book and she asked if she could take a couple of drumsticks home. He then eagerly showed me a video of her playing the beginnings of a New Orleans beat.

Drinking coffee is leaving me cranky and messing with sleep. But things are clicking in the mornings. You’re on to something with this method.

Things are getting tasty in the run up to Circo Voador. The advance online tickets ran out fast. 1.600 in a day. Then the discussions. Eventually went with Lencinho’s idea to tell everyone that their tickets do not guarantee entry, to avoid us effectively turning people away front the circo to guarantee entry for a bunch of people who end up flaking.

2022

**Daily nugget: Use the mouthpiece that gets you through the gig**

When you played with the squadronnaires you struggled partly because the 1.25 C made it hard work. For the sake of a slightly prettier sound in the solo, you sacrificed your overall professional performance. When you left, you could hardly get a decent reference.

You should use the mouthpiece which allows you to hold it together through the gig because tired chops sound worse than anything. Think about where else in life you could apply this principle: where else are you getting the priorities wrong and need to compromise? Where else are you obviously cracking important notes for the sake of subtleties that only you can hear?

Looks like Dad won’t be coming out of hospital just yet. He’s got a radio now, that’s one of the few positives. Sounds like he’s suffering from quite strong dementia now. Be nice to think there’s something they can fix, like low sodium or a urine infection, but we have to be prepared for that not to be the case.

Did a more focused piano practice today on the first Bach 2-part intervention and discovered the joy in really focusing on it, honing in and repeating passages, getting stuff well and truly under the fingers. Piano practice has to be like this and first thing.

Glória market with Thamires and Tailan yesterday - very tasty fish feijoada and then took electric scooters around the Aterro do Flamengo. Can’t do PIX from my account because credit card bill is unpaid, so relying on a loan from Mum to be able to do the building work. Kids will be expensive, so suddenly feeling a lot less secure financially. If PRIO were to pull the plug on Favela Brass, you’d be looking

In a bad mood earlier on. Stressed about finance meeting and tired. Diana came over to look at website and I ended up doing a load of meditating. This helped immensely. Dude, don’t forget this. Meditation is how you enjoy life and crucial for your shortcomings.

Another wonderful weekend with Thamires: watched Ataque Brasil at the Cozinha da Lapa Saturday, Sunday playing frigoball and listening to 90s music at the aterro do flamengo then made prawn curry which she loved. Wow!

2022

End of term bash at ciep. You’re exhausted and brain not really there. Forgot to play tuba for first bit. Must sort out the whole mics bit. But worst thing was that you forgot some recorder student’s names. Mangueirinha recorded it and posted a video of it on the group while Cris came in with the comments. With friends like these…

Recognizing that both Mangueirinha and Cris will use any opportunity to try and bring you down, you can slowly, carefully trim their participation in the project down. Do not let yourself get isolated from any of the various groups (as Cris would like) and refer to Chapter 15 of the laws of human nature.

Think about it. Cris tries to isolate you from: partners (Paraty, Getúlio Vargas, Senador Corrêa), team members (telling raissa not to have meetings with you), and is probably working on parents and students as well (judged by yesterday). Don’t let this happen. Be present, be nice, be organized.

Out to play with Dzaritmik at a bloco heading from largo das neves to cozinha da lapa. General level of musicianship not high enough to stave off the tiredness and once the boom-chi started up it was time to go.

Kids seemed excited about the possibility of camping today. Maybe the whole band camp at Geoffrey’s might be a goer.

2021

England beat Ukraine 4-0 in the Euros quarter final. Oli come over with Alice, nice BBQ and beers. Amazing to see everyone so positive about the England team and manager.

Thought about you and Favela Brass and maybe something you can fall back on is the purpose. It’s not about you, you don’t matter. It’s about music lessons for favela kids.

Writing petrobras grant is slow going but the overall shape of what we want to do seems to be coming together - include horns lessons in the schools, add a couple of schools in Rio comprido, trips to Curitiba and Araraquara and weekly shows at coretos and praças around the city. Also the digital learning aspect.

“I don’t have any distinction between weekdays and weekends, it’s all one for me. . . People sometimes view routines or habits in a negative way, “Wouldn’t it be great to be so free, to do whatever you want.” To me that’s like hell, like a nightmare. I would hate that. I want life to be relatively simple and digestible. Maybe that’s a weakness on my part. To me, routines and rituals are very liberating and soothing. I can’t imagine life without them.

Just so satisfying to do meeze, trumpet and piano practice (Bach 1 round keys) in the evening. The thing about laying things out for the next day is so important for relaxing. Also make a mental note: since starting fasting in the evenings you been sleeping through till morning.

Loving the morning bike ride with strict time limit of 6:30 before turning back. You were about 100m off the caixa d’água today. I would place a fairly hefty bet on you finally making it all the way in 1 tomorrow. Art of manliness podcast the perfect companion. Mornings are bliss at the mo.

The terrible talks with Rafael and Lucia’s parents. Times like these make me want out.

Received £50k in inheritance. Gave £800 to Stugger.

HASfit strength building for the first time in a while.

Another good oficina at the coreto modernista. Did the different instruments at the 4 points of the star for the first time and the rhythm lesson at 9:30. Thinking about it that rhythm lesson was purest flow. And they really got it.

Out for beers with Joe, Geoffrey, Luke Downdney and Tom Lemesurier on Friday at Gomes. Drank far too much horrible hangover. Luke Downey interesting - very sure of himself which I think could be why people invest in him. Didn’t come off as a particularly nice person, or particularly interested in his cause. Said “fuck charity” alot.

Still digesting the Dad thing. Could this be your Scrooge moment? Where you realize that what matters is how you treat the people close to you, starting with family? That’s all well and good, but it’s all a bit late for Dad.

Make the long-term decisions. Successfully turned the phone off for 24 hours to establish your Sunday - Monday lunch sabbath.

I think a lot of the grieving for Dad happened last week, but now it’s individual things that set the thoughts off. I wish me and Mum had been a bit better through his last days and I feel guilty about even thinking about going back to Brazil near the end.

Apparently he said to Mum “all we can do is make this work” after they both left their shitty marriages. All you can do now is make your life work. I.E. Don’t get yourself killed, find a beautiful black Brazilian girl, start your band, make some money and look after it. Health, family, wealth. 

Worried that Bindu may get a hold of the favela fofocas and not let go. Not a huge amount you can do. A good thing about this situation is that it obliges you to be nice to everyone. Just keep your head clear and do your best..

In the middle of a fairly mad rush to get our videos done for this collaboration with DYJA. Rethinking the big band chart writing every morning. Basically, without actually recording the charts you don’t really know if they work and hence can’t finish them. And, there’s no band to play them. When there’s so much to sort it feels a bit indulgent starting each weekday with this.

Making piano a leisure activity worked, and today (saturday) it was enjoyable spending the whole morning on writing the deixa eu dizer arrangement. In Donny you love nothing more than writing and recording in the morning and playing piano in the evenings.

You could also hire or find somewhere to go (I.e. a studio) for recording days/sessions. Given the hassle of moving instruments a whole week somewhere would make sense. You have friends with sítios...

Angelo talking about his vision to Norton’s gang worried me a bit: “imagine a Rio
where instead of seeing a black youth and wondering if he’ll pull out a gun, people will wonder which instrument he’ll pull out.” - can’t seeing that going down well with Melissa. Or anyone black.

Just at the end of a trip back to the UK. Family camp was good, barring Oli’s tangle with a motorbike at the end. Curry with the boys today and one or two seem interested in coming to Brazil for the wedding - Cris Barnacoat and maybe Ellis. Met Pottsie last week who is talking about taking the family out. Would have been great to bring Thamires, but difficult with her work leave situation, and she didn’t really want to go because it’s a lot of money.

Reading Traction by Gino Wickman and see in it a way out of this mess, and a future sustainable role for you at Favela Brass. The big question: is Pat your integrator? Our first team meeting back after the holidays today didn’t bode well, with her watching the olympics while we were having the meeting. Remember the first meetings when she paid attention more than Cris? 

2023

Back to Rio. Drive down to Heathrow with Mum and have a full-strength cappuccino at Cafe Nero. Put up rubbish trem bala London x São Paulo joke on instagram. Must do better (but also must keep posting - it keeps you on people’s radars).

No problem taking the tuba on, just crossing fingers now that you get through customs ok in Rio. Melissa and Jeremy on the flight, which is delayed over 3 hours. Rueing not putting your hand up straight away for the 600 euros offered to take the next flight.

Listening to a great audiobook: winning minds. This is definitely worth listening to again. Lots of interesting ideas: one part that rang true just now is the need for the leader to diffuse tension - to put people at ease. Pam brings an intense stress to the work that rubs off on everyone else.

Photo from 2008 popped on Facebook with me and Stugger in Wembley in our Doncaster Rovers gear. Sent it to Stugger and he replied saying it popped up for him too and he thought how much can change in 14 years. He’s right.

Things really picked up for you after that. At least you have a life now - you really didn’t in 2008. You may be working a lot, you may be dealing with sticky politics, but you are living and you have found your niche. 

Actually, you’re still connected to that crazy 2008 Tom Ashe, still with the mission of promoting great live music. And that Tom Ashe wasn’t that bad. Just needed to get out there. Idealistic, yes, naive, yes. But a good person.

You have to remember to always thank Brazil for that - for bringing you out of yourself.

Morning messed up by computer slowing down to a snails pace (had to delete a bunch of files and re-index spotlight but took me a while to get there), but made progress on these charts for the kids to play with projeto Guri (this is starting to feel like a drag but they are a big project: think impact of your materials).

When you finish half an hour of taking tunes round all 12 keys that’s like getting to the top of the hill on your bike: now you can just breeze down the other side admiring the scenery i.e. playing other tunes in their original key.

Piano is the best thing for your head. The favorite leisure activity. This is your baseline - “is this use of leisure time as good as playing piano?” Think how much you would love to sight read to a high standard on the piano, to fully understand a tune’s harmony just by playing it.

That’s the thing. The round the keys thing is the germane learning. It means that as you go on you start to understand tunes harmonically whatever key they are presented in and wherever they modulate to. It also means in the end you will play tunes from memory in different keys and have enough mental bandwidth left over to analyze the harmony as you go.

On a slightly less lofty note I just thought of the Tinder trick of offering to write them a new description. Fun, and very effective. Starting to think green tea has some kind of mystical quality for stimulating creativity. Coffee/black tea fit for cranking it out, green tea for divergent thinking - the real creative breakthroughs.

Loooong day. Stress in the morning when it was looking like I wouldn’t get the website back. Said goodbye to Gustavo and realized he ate the leftover cake from Favela Brass birthday = a lot of cake! Giving Camila a hard time about the newsletter.

Senador Corrêa and pereira lessons ok. Going to be slow work with these recorders. Favela Brass AGM dragged on but at least they liked the 2021 Annual Report (which I thought looked amateurish).

PRIO aren’t going to pay the money we need till mid-November, so there’s going to be a merry dance to try and keep the lights on until then. Need more sponsors. Rafael’s designer sent a version of the rouanet 2025 presentation that you thought was shit. Gharish, hard to read (looks like a terrorist ransom note at points), and without a professional look. Am I being a perfectionist? I think not this time.

You now have today to finish the rouanet project for Germany. Jesus Amado.

2021

On the plane back from Curitiba. Bit hung over from night at swanky cocktail bar followed by Gato Preto. Was great seeing the music school at Dorcas, meeting Tio Ali and watching Associacao Sao Roque’s Lei Rounet-sponsored film.

Overall, though, Curitiba was pretty underwhelming. Just felt like a half-assed Germany. Won’t be going back there in a hurry.

Was inspiring talking to Ed though. Going to double down on the Rouanet now. Sounds like he might even throw us something this year. You need someone like Ed as Executive Director and Margo as President. You could be programs director.

Mental note: Stop pandering to Mangueirinha. He just called, was rude and hung up because Maria Leopoldina is shut when it’s really not your fault. You’re paying week in and week out for services you don’t need in the schools and at CIEP and in the favela out of guilt and fear. Stop it. Move him out bit by bit and don’t move him back in.

Listening to 4000 weeks. It’s the right book for the moment and very pertinent for you and your idleness averse, future-obsessed ways. The whole settling thing, accepting finitude, cultivating the joy of missing out. Coming to terms with the fact that it will always be like this.

Had the idea of hiring Cris as coordenador let’s hope she goes for it. Someone that will pitch in and that you like working with.

2020

Over the weekend been working on the first theory video, which is taking longer than expected. Need to keep on this though - the theory videos should help a lot, and the resulting keynote presentations ill be a great tool to use in the lessons as well. 

Went for long walks yesterday and Saturday with no headphones and had good ideas both days. Including going back to the Praça São Salvador idea on Saturdays (great visibility, perfect location, studio for drums, great bandstand for tiering sections) with the midweek being for individual lessons and sectionals. Use your house for classes, not big rehearsals. During the weeks you should have a grade 1 trumpet class, grade 4 sax. etc. etc. maybe even grade 1 theory, grade 3 keyboard harmony etc. The week should be about the classes and Saturday is showtime. Make Saturday an amazing public spectacle somewhere (maybe optional extra Sunday at Flamengo beach as well…)

Maybe a good start would be Saturday (praça SS) and Sunday (Flamengo beach) drop-ins with the volunteer teachers, aimed at the school kids. Later on Sunday could be an optional percussion with Mangueirinha plus instrumental lesson pull-outs. Becomes obligatory for kids who can’t do Sat.

The main recent development is that you’re now writing for full big band. There are a lot of good reasons for this:

1. A bigger band means a larger proportion of the students in the top bands - not just a small group having all the fun.
2. Reverse economics - the bigger the band the more students learning per director rehearsal hour.
3. Charts can be made much easier with a large band - backings put in sax section, easy lower brass parts.
4. There are much more youth big bands out there for us to do exchanges with. 
5. If we’re about playing in the street without mics, then we need that volume of sound from lots of players which also can balance a 4-5 piece percussion section.
6. Having drums + percussion means out percussionists can be learning drums as well.

If we say we’re starting a big band a year, that seems like a reasonable target (push to 5 tpts/5 troms/ 5 Perc)

Also, imagine if one day you manage to do a baile de carnaval with big band - maybe at circo voador / jubilee hall (for kids baile). That’s your annual fund raiser sorted! Get NYBB to come and do the pro band… TIME TO GET WRITING!

2. Do you have the materials and equipment to do your work right?
3. At work, do you have the opportunity to do what you do best every day?
4. In the last seven days, have you received recognition or praise for doing good work?
5. Does your supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about you as a person?
6. Is there someone at work who encourages your development?
7. At work, do your opinions seem to count?
8. Does the mission/purpose of your company make you feel your job is important?
9. Are your associates(fellow employees) committed to doing quality work?
10. Do you have a best friend at work?
11. In the last six months, has someone at work talked to you about your progress?
12. In the last year, have you had opportunities to learn and grow?

2025

Taylor working on the getting the 10 years film down to size. Seems like this 20-minute piece will be ok in an of itself, but will lay the ground for a better longer film down the road. This film stuff takes up a lot of time though.

Liking this 1-hour daily-ish arranging straight after the piano, and the trumpet target of getting through the omnibook once a month is also working (actually looks like I am going to hit a trumpet target for once). 

Building work in full swing upstairs (and in the street). Trying to tread the line between overspending and cheaping out too much. 

2023

Weird period. Just grinding through the admin, interviews, rouanet readequação, communications, upcoming gigs etc. etc. - didn’t even manage the 30 mins piano today shock horror, make that first thing every day now. No time for arranging OK but the piano + trumpet are sacred. You’re stressed, no 2 ways about that (though YouTube comedy vids help). Especially with the job applicants for produtora of Favela Brass who have been kept waiting. Lots of interest in the room on Airbnb. This could be a winner. Chuck Joe out and make R$3.000 a month off the house! Or put him in your room (paying same rent) and a third of the Airbnb action. Then you’re looking at R$3.000 a month without you doing anything and you can buy another place. Just a thought.

Did have another thought: a top-notch brass band playing around Rio with your arrangements all year is an investable Rouanet project.

2022

Had a breakthrough in the morning. I always say this but I really think this is the format: tune related technical warm up exercises, then tune in standard notation, rest of arrangement bits, then a lookup chart for transposing melody to other key. After that I was pretty useless. It’s pretty relentless now and starting to grate that o just don’t get any days off at all in practice.

Good first rehearsal back in the favela and the materials worked a treat. Good turn out.

2021

Fairly productive Sunday. Bought a new toilet for upstairs, straightened things out about rent and house things with Joe and Amelia (Amelia didn’t like being limited to an hour of practice a day), tidied things up and did a decent amount of piano practice. Enjoying the idea of piano as a leisure pursuit, and the big band arranging as well. When you learned the trumpet it was a leisure pursuit that was fitted around school studying.

Seriously thinking about flipping things up - what if I only had caffeine on the weekends and holidays to fuel long uninterrupted writing sessions? What if you did your deep work in an immersive kind of way rather than a short stint every morning?

Amelia produced an amazing instagram stories ad for our Patreon - was a good idea earmarking the Patreon cash for volunteers and we need to try and retain Amelia doing our instagram feed for us.

Easter Sunday painting beams upstairs in house with Thamires ready for Joe to make the move. Place looks great, good investment. Try to send out special invites for Circo Voador but various invites are missing and the text isn’t ready. Rafael let me down a bit with this - should have been done at least a week ago (but still your fault, project cronograma and budget should have been demanded)

2022

Lunch with Alexandre and Patricio at Bafo da Prainha. Looks like Favela Brass will be able to play there and maybe at their kiosk in leme as well. Bloody amazing cupim. Have to go to this place again.

Saw centro Hélio oiticica with Cris which looks fine and then met with Binha and Renata from Cozinha da lapa. Had the idea of the crack at the cozinha after Cacilda on Sundays and of making Cacildas birthday April 1st. Genius. If you put as much effort into this as you do into Tinder you might get some real life action.

Stood up by Jaqui from Ribeirão Preto then couldn’t face Hedi’s alone at 9pm.

2021

First impressions of this new way of working (i.e. whole day business/program/curriculum) are pretty good. Coming to the end of a long day on the curriculum and despite a slow start the whole thing got into gear and you ended the day with a really good whiteboard brainstorm till about 8:30 (started 5 in the morning).

I know where I will pick up on Saturday (making complete books) and am looking forward to filling my head with completely different (but related) challenges tomorrow. For some reason looking forward to a cup of coffee and doing the accounts first thing!

Tinder a big distraction. Maybe I should set limits on this, or maybe I need to make all the romantic connections I can after losing more than a year of dating at a crucial time. You’re losing too much focus to messages and news.

Up 4:30 to finish barbie. Show with profs for kids at Vital Brasil and Pereira Passos (Cris hadn’t advised us). Spoke to Cris about her recent breakdown and ended up talking about Pam. You probably said too much, although nice to know that it’s not just you. 

Problem is you complained to Pam about Cris, then complained to Cris about Pam. You’re shitting where you eat. You undermined Pam. Yes you and Cris got things done last year but you also butted heads. Things you said that you shouldn’t have:

- You think Pam’s talking to Sômulo
- Your pissed off that Pam blamed Vivi leaving on you and Cris
- Pam’s stressing you out as well

This reinforces the shitty dynamic of both you and Pam as team managers - who talks to Cris?

What you don’t want is you and Cris in the same boat as the ones making everyone’s life difficult. 

If Pam x Raissa x Sabrina are tight, you’re in a minority about Pam being difficult. In that case you’ll be under pressure to stick with Pam. 

Sounds like Sabrina and Cris aren’t getting on (Sabrina does show signs of being a bit of a cow though). A

The coffee is making you a bit hyper.

Today you stretched. Running from Leme to Copacabana in the morning, lots of admin through the day. Recording with Ana Laura, lesson for Maria Fernanda and Maria Rita, then recording over at Fogueteiro, then home and played the 25 bergmuller studies. You go to bed spent, and this is definitely the best feeling.

Down at Copacabana beach today a stall holder sidled up while you were practicing trumpet in a practice mute. Contrary to expectations he asked me if I could take the mute out! Brazil is something else...

Settling in to life back in Donny. More good ideas with Petrobras grant application. Definitely enjoying concentrating on this side of things “for a bit”. Point is, while you are in the executive director role you will be judged on how much cash you bring in. And you’ll never get to concentrate on the music and teaching side if you don’t have the cash to hire people.

Thinking too much about Stugger. How to minimize the damage he could inflict.

Things a bit better. I think this has a lot to do with less meetings - Pam didn’t like hearing it, but may have got the message that her job is to free me you. You’re also a bit more organized now with the lists in Reminders.

Doing 3 pomodoros of arranging in the morning pretty solidly now and it’s really getting stuff shifted. Would be lovely to do more, but just try to hold on to this - the holy trinity. The whole thing about small, regular saving.

Tempted to start my own band, but also reticent to add another layer of complexity. Think I like more the idea of me being the arranger for all the bands - your band is Favela Brass.

Did grade 1, exercise 1 rhythm reading video today - I think you’re getting the knack of useable videos now. At some point need to redo the horns videos.

Bitten by a dog on the cycle ride this morning which didn’t stop me managing to make it up to the caixa d’água before 6:30
for the first time. Listening to the Art of Impossible which really fitted.

At the mo my scorecard is doing 75-90 minutes of deep work in the morning, trumpet practice (Louis Armstrong solos 1-22), piano practice and the meeze. Meeze was a bit weak but basically ticked the boxes today.

Strange to be so excited about getting up at 5 tomorrow morning - compare and contrast with the days when you had to get up at 5 to go to barra for TBS. That alarm clock sound from those days fills you with dread still. TBS was pretty crappy, but paid the bills.

Yesterday had a long session reading the Nadia Boulanger biography and listening to Lili Boulanger. Something so special about an extended reading session. Reading the 2019 entry makes me cringe about how much longer I could have been with Thamires (even though she’s a bit difficult at the moment what with the hormones). 

2020

Favelagrafia want to do a recording with the kids. They want 10 kids from turma 1 to record a tune somewhere in a favela, but then it starts to become unclear.

It’s something to do with a commercial for Boticário but he’s saying that the commercial has already been made and this is an “acao em conjunto”. When I asked about COVID he said we’d be wearing gloves.

When I asked about cash they said there would be money for the kids. Didn’t even consider the possibility that the project should get some cash. And they have started by talking to the lads in fogueteiro and saying there might be cash which doesn’t help.

Also the reference they sent was when you wish upon a star with Louis Armstrong which is all strings and vocal. Some of silly talk about “abrindo vozes” and assuming that I will do an arrangement for free. And the magic line about exposure for the project.

All in all not ideal but 2 problems for dismissing it: wouldn’t be good for relationship with kids in Fogueteiro or with Favelagrafia (who have already done us a favor), local project etc. Also, it’s you saying no to stuff, holding the project back from doing stuff.

Very tempted to just recommend them a string project in the nicest possible way. Would be nice to help them, but once we’ve said yes I’m worried they will take the piss in terms of COVID and how long we have to play for. And also, is this really going to work?

So there you have it. A nice juicy leader’s dilemma. Enough to stress you out and mess with your sleep last night. Mental note: you hate this stuff.

End of day update: you turned it around. Came up with the idea of sexta básicas to avoid the money issues, wrote the arrangement, set the location, spoke to the parents. Mental note: you love this stuff.

2019

Blue Note finally paid so I’m ok for cash. Part of me thinks I should have got out of the British School this year. Financially it’s doable now. Trying to think of a project for next year that could get me working in a better capacity with the British and American schools. Carnival melodica and percussion blocos. Paid extra-curricular activity? (they might take it more seriously if they pay)

Saturday was Amit’s fun run at the Lagoa. As predicted hardly anyone participated (BCS demographics), but it was good networking. Nice to have a beer with Amit and Bill afterwards.

Friday took Joy to Bar dos Descasados. She’s obviously very sexual - i.e. likes sex! And although she has clearly been reading from the same hymn sheet as Talita in terms of feminism etc.. she is a lot more chilled out and cooperative, which was the point all along.

Yesterday picket up bracelets from Alison Correa and asked her if she wants to be on the board for Favela Brass which she didn’t seem to be sure about. Then went to Santa Teresa with Kenny to try and get a gig at Favela Hype but the manager wasn’t there. Life is good.

Rainy day in Engenho do Mato. In a routine of getting up at 5 every day, having a coffee and doing 25-30 mins of concentrated piano practice (Grieg poetic tone-picture no.6 at the moment). This brings you on as a musician - it’s just as important as arranging, and with the zero-tolerance aspect also serves as a mindfulness exercise. Thinking about maybe adding an extra step of composing a piece in a similar style after mastering each tune through the keys.

Just seen that Grieg’s lyric pieces were the most influential piano works during the belle époque and we even have them graded, starting from where you are:

This all started with your Dad’s final days where the music that helped most was the Arietta. One of those moments where you realize what you love - a moment of transcendence. From playing it badly on an out of tune piano at the funeral you now have until his 100th birthday to learn to compose your own lyric pieces.

With exactly 288 weeks left, you can dedicate 144 to mastering each of the 66 lyric pieces, then the following 144 to writing your own - the apprenticeship phase, followed by the creative-active. Remember, you can study Grieg all you like, but it will still come out as you.

Imagine if you also made enough money to buy the family a new Yamaha U3, or perhaps even a used grand. R$100.000 over 5 years gives roughly R$1.500 a month. Instead of a just a studio, create your music room. A big soundproofed , air-conditioned space where bands can play as well. 

2020

Moved to the upstairs flat which may actually be worse. Just no getting away from the noise of the road. Been managing to get work done although the whole dodgy Bluetooth keyboard/mouse connection to the Mac mini has been slowing things down.

Had a stressful Saturday worrying about getting the Banco do Brasil internet banking up and running (which involved cajoling Angelo and Melissa) and also coming clean to Amelia about the extra melodica videos. Even with a day’s distance these seem like small things that shouldn’t be giving you a day of stress. Anyway it all seemed to work out ok and the Sukiyaki video is looking and sounding great.

Thinking that it might not have been the best thing to do to get involved with Adrienne. It has been great, but worry that she’s going to get hurt. To be fair she’s so nice that she could be a contender. It’s just physically that I feel more of a fit with girls like Talita. She’s pressuring me to meet up today which I’m resisting. We went to the northeastern buffet place yesterday which was very nice indeed - and hot with the chilli sauce.

The house thing is a real bummer - it means you can’t really chill out at home. And the idea was that you’d be able to have some peace to chill out and work. Bit like the garage, but on the beach. In a quandary about whether to fork out another 1.500 for a decent place over the next couple of weeks, whether to even maybe move on to another place, or just find some way to spend as little time at home as possible.

Spent a lot of time on Airbnb but not had been hit by any inspiring options really. Also have to think a bit about when you want to start doing socially-distanced group things with favela brass and when you want to go back to the UK. My feeling is to to whatever traveling now and get back from the UK ready to go straight away early-mid Jan. Maybe break things up with one week out of aracaju?

Today is first day for a while with no coffee or tea. Brought it down gently last week with green tea. Feeling pretty lethargic and out of sorts now but nothing too much. Strange feeling of not wanting to do anything but not wanting to do nothing.

Didn’t do much for 42nd birthday yesterday - spent most of the time organizing the piano folder which I’m proud of. Focus on one piece for 25, review deck for 25, take one piece round keys for 25. When all tunes are learned do a new deck and review this one once a week. Leitner boxes.

Val and Hardy over today great to see them and fun learning German card games and technical terms. I only did 25 mins piano. Work it back?

No Enemies

By Charles Mackay

(English Chartist poet, 1814–1889)
 
YOU have no enemies, you say?	
  Alas! my friend, the boast is poor;	
He who has mingled in the fray	
  Of duty, that the brave endure,	
Must have made foes! If you have none,	       
Small is the work that you have done.	
You’ve hit no traitor on the hip,	
You’ve dashed no cup from perjured lip,	
You’ve never turned the wrong to right,	
You’ve been a coward in the fight.	        
 
As quoted by Margaret Thatcher to the Queen on Netflix, which I just watched on my first night back at home in Donny on the my fantastic new portable monitor and AKG headphones. It feels a little “cushy” to be taking a whole month out of Rio, but you can make it productive (recording the big band charts), and then you can have a clear shot at going straight through with the kids from January til July.

Started listening to Stalingrad on the way over, which was much more of a history book than I thought it was - for some reason I had it in my head that it was some kind of historical novel. Anyway fascinating stuff and in a strange way inspiring - what on earth do you have to complain about, compared to anyone who was involved on either side in that battle? 

Been a few days since I did the diary. There was the whole thing with Kayra - a learning experience I guess. Had a beer with Tom Le Mesurier who I have to say I don’t particularly like after the whole Somebody Feed Phil Thing - gives me the creeps now. Caught up with Bob over the phone - long overdue.

Cestas básicas from the Favelagrafia recording have arrived and I am just hoping that they don’t cause a kerfuffle. And Elber had decided that João Pedro should be going in for his Grade 1 in January when anyone with half a brain knows he’s somewhere between grade 2 and 4. Rafael also has not been using the books.

And now Talita wants to talk. This is your fault, you led her on. Either you’re in or you’re out my friend - doesn’t do anyone any good to be on the fence.

Productive day yesterday - a combination of getting up early, timeboxing and drinking tea. Dealing with the silly ideas of the board about the Circo Voador event (wristbands for all adults, obrigatory rental of ecocopos). Sômulo exposing himself as an absolute tyrant which might be a good thing: the other board members need to be alert to the danger of his becoming president and/or extending his term.

Sol has blocked Cris which is an ominous sign: a lawsuit is the last thing we need.

Must be the time of year. It’s pretty full on here as well. Waiting for Lei Rouanet money, preparing for Paraty, orienting new team. Mum arrives tomorrow then you’re off to Florianopolis with Thamires as well. Unlike to be able to get too far from work. Have started drinking coffee and arranging in the mornings which is good but crowding out piano. 

2022

Long day. Admin marathon. It just comes in from all sides. You’re meditating and not drinking coffee, so you’re tired and stressed but still just about holding it together. Did have time to watch the first episode of Fargo series which was great.

It really does feel like you might burn out here.

“Assim como o brasileiro foi educado para perder, o americano foi educado para ganhar.”
- Tom Jobim

Big day. Still working on format for instrument books and the micro-levels thing is looking great. Had the idea of dispensing even with the counting syllables and just using the image of the notes as lines against a counting grid: count the grid then play the rhythm. Do not forget this.

Long chat with Ed Matkin. He could be the partner for the instrumental grade books. If he could handle the selling part and a publisher the making and distributing, you could just write great method books and get paid for it. For me I like the idea of a joint brand with Ed, 50/50 after wherever the publisher takes. Passive income, Robert Kiyosaki would be proud. Of course he could sell you down the river too.

Posted Maria Rita playing Anunciação to thank FFT. Very good reception on Instagram. 

The Art of Impossible book making a big impact. Seems to have made me stop drinking. Gradually finding ways to cram all the daily weekly practices in and they definitely seem to be adding up to a better way of living and working.

Dad a bit better apparently. Let’s hope he gets back on a level. He’s got his little pocket radio now so hopefully that might help with the boredom if he manages to work it. Sounds like he might be chatting the nurses up as well which is a good sign.

After the initial success with having a day off coffee doing another one today. Headache hasn’t materialized but not much work has either. Yesterday was England vs Senegal at abcd with pre-match barbecue, so was going to be a slow day anyway.

Right. Listening to the 7 rules of power and the penny has dropped: you need a rougher edge - you need to stop worrying about what people think. You can’t keep everyone happy and you will never be able to make an omelette without breaking eggs. They play dirty, you need to stand your ground.

Speak less, use more direct language. Say what needs to be said. They want you to **lead them to victory**: competence, boldness, confidence. Be wrong sometimes, make enemies. Tune in to your rebel days at school: you’re going to die - why not test the limits?

2021

In a bad mood. Sunday night and staying in at Selina. Had BCS event on Saturday, then beers and pizza, then aterro this morning, then nobody turned up to Cacilda so you went for a drink with Tadeu.

The method is in a good place. All you need to do now is crank out more tunes and references. Transition to tea before you fall out with too many people. It’s done.

It seems like you always think that you have finally settled on the right format, then you go and change it. However, even with that caveat, this current set up does look good with the group method technical warm up, then the figurenotes tunes  transposing into 2 keys, and the patterns warm up as well. Think you may have cracked it

Last day of relative calm before Teresópolis and another 4 gigs with Favela Brass in the space of a week. In a last-minute dash to get one more rouanet sponsor and avoid having to cut back on teacher’s hours at a time when we have more and more students starting on wind instruments. Frustrating time pinning down the budget with Raissa, who continually gets the wrong end of the stick, and then tries to blame you (“eu não sei se você lembre”, “talvez foi muita coisa para a sua cabeça”). Good news is that she’ll be out of the leadership team next year in favour of Jane.

Ah remember that Art of Manliness podcast with a very soft-spoken guest called Mithu Storoni. Try and incorporate this voice a bit with the way you communicate. Rather than being loud and heavy-handed, which takes you down a peg, go for the reserved, controlled, educated approach.

2023

Great trip to Teresopolis. Revived the love for the project for some reason. Decided that we have to do a summer school there at the end of Jan 2025 and that this summer school will be the focus for next year.

2024
At danger of entering into dangerous water with Pat. She’s taken on this other job with Rede Cruzada and the feeling is that she’s not giving it her all with Favela Brass. The other feeling is that there’s an element of her wanting to do what you don’t want her to do (writing projects, liasing with the patrocinador) and not wanting to do what you do want her to do (updating the budget spreadsheet).

It’s not all-out warfare, but you need to work on this relationship. As much as anything, whether you like it or not, she has the power to bad-mouth you to her friend at PRIO, Camilla.

Yesterday you went to PRIO asking for instruments, when it turns out that you still have space in the budget. You just hadn’t gone into Raissa’s budget in time to verify that we really do have a surplus. Pat could snitch on that. Just be smart about it and don’t draw attention to it.

Worried about your memory. Had some senior moments recently that were different from before: forgetting the topic of conversation mid-conversation. Anything that can be done to mitigate this would be great: lots of exercise, less booze and less caffeine would seem good places to start.

Listening to “Coming Up for Air” for a second time: this is really the book you were looking for. What you really dread is the idea of being an incompetent leader that makes life hard for your team. With the recommendations in the book you have the chance to make things better in this respect - go for it!

2021

Bit stressy the whole grant deadline thing and having to get it looked at and approved by the board. Meeting will be a late one tomorrow, this whole week will be a bit less than relaxing. Had a nice little play on the piano and the creative chops seem to have come on a lot. Wouldn’t it be nice to have some time off just to do that?

Sounds like Mum and Dad arguing from the next room although I could be wrong. Very tough time for both of them as Dad slows down.

Fantastic day at Itacoatiara beach yesterday with Thamires. Water just right for swimming, listening to the Sony stereo speakers made all the difference. Stayed there from 08:30 to 15:30 and didn’t have any idea we were there so long. At points, you managed to put the work stuff out of your mind and be in the moment. Meditation is there for you to be able to do this.

One thing that came to mind while swimming was that perhaps there is an element missing to all of this 4000 weeks stuff about not spending life just pursuing goals the whole time. That element being the simple idea of rhythms of tension and release in life. If we want to enjoy life, then working towards goals and then relaxing a bit, then working towards the next one is a satisfying rhythm. 

Yes it’s a bit like we’re on a treadmill, but it’s a virtuous cycle - we set up a goal about how things could be a bit better, get at it (tension), then go to the beach, drink and listen to music (release). We spend our lives engaged it the pleasurable business of making life slightly better. The problem for you has not been so much that you’re living a goal-oriented life - that’s what gives life meaning - but rather the workload has been so high that even in the moments that should be in release, you’re in tension worrying about what’s not getting done.

To get the tension x release thing right you not only have to have release, but you have to set it up by working well in tension. Really get at it. The worst feeling in the world is that you kind of drifted when you should have been working, so the release hasn’t been earned. Think about being at uncle Paul’s with Dad: you were working during the day to earn your BBQ at night, and that’s why you have such a happy memory of that time.

Think about the stress of Favela Brass (and dealing with Pam) as part of the tension. You endure all sorts of difficulty during the week - pressure, difficult decisions, wrong decisions, embarrassment, self-doubt, petty politics, anger  -  in the service of a good cause,  and in doing so earn the right to go to the beach at the weekend and spend hours on end drinking and relaxing in the sun.

If you run away from the tension, you’ll never enjoy the release.

2022

Rehearsal at CIEP despite still testing positive for COVID. Started Marcelo on trumpet, Vinicio on trombone, Rian on sax, and Zuri is starting on trombone as well. Really this lesson can run with just you, Joe and Mangueirinha at a push. You can start mixed groups of beginners off, then take the band for the last 30 mins.

Cancelled Cacilda - hardly any students, it’s inside, and after the rehearsal I was just completely knackered. Think this might be it for Cacilda. It’s just too much. Organizing an oficina is kind of social, but only if you actually have students. Take Sunday back.

“Pay it forward, because you can’t pay it back.”

Learned that one the hard way.

Shagged Thamires yesterday. Lunch in Santa Teresa then Parque das Ruínas. Was thinking it was all sorted then she said she doesn’t want kids. Putz.

My band at pizzaria do Hedi yesterday as well. Musically good fun (though felt a bit rusty), and another full night. Hedi just coming back after COVID and other illness. 

Aterro earlier on went ok, looks like we have a coherent couple of bands there now.

Favela Brass at pizzaria Friday and brought Vivi and Pamela together with Cris, Raissa and Camila. Cris comes out with the whole thing about “Eu e Vivi vamos fazer o baile juntos” and “sou desobedecente”. She’s going to be doing everything she can to undermine you with the new recruits you can be sure of that.

During the week working with Vivi and Pamela to get them up to speed. It’s a lot to explain and there’s loads to do. They seem really happy to be working for Favela Brass though. Overall I’m optimistic, just a bit wary of Cris’s politics.

The penny dropped this week that maybe it would be a good idea to buy next door. You could stick it on Airbnb and link it with you place. Maybe get stuff up and running then think about what would be best in terms of reforms. Jaider wants 300k.

Getting into the rhythm with Thiago - basically you’re doing most of the cooking and washing up and all of the supermarket shopping while Thamires is doing pretty much everything with the baby. You’re singing to him as well. Not an 80/20-type relationship vibe though - you need to do more to pull your weight.

Still obsessed with AI and you’re focusing getting Favela Brass’s data into Coda at the mo. Still trying to work out how far all this automation will go, what it means for Favela Brass, Brassify, Copa da Cacilda. Hope it means you can get enough cash in for Thamires to be able to stay at home.

Told Joe and Camila last week that they have to be out of 19b by the end of the year.

Yesterday accepted the “de cria para cria” award at the câmara municipal with Henri. Seemed so tribal (the tribe in question not being yours) and was nice to be out of there. Still Favela Brass now has a pretty certificate.

Much more interestingly, stumbled on the solfege methods by Dannhäuser and Lavignac, and also Eileen Sauer’s page (prompted by the MTB tests asking students to sing intervals). Thinking about the way to incorporate this: you now have rhythm reading, theory, solfege, harmony and improvisation to fit in there. Maybe an hour of rhythm reading and theory on one side, and an hour of solfege, harmony and improvisation on the other.

2023

Léo the builder is putting a new roof on upstairs - so far seems like he knows what he’s doing.

The business with the neighbours is leaking back in. In a nasty situation with the Mums this could be used against you and probably already is. As Mangueirinha says, the danger is not the lawsuit, it’s the rumours. You’re doing the right thing - make the project less dependent on you, set up your home outside the favela, gradually take the project to the schools.

The tricky part is the role of Cris in this. She’s slippery, and doesn’t mind playing dirty. She is probably playing you and the mums off against each other to some degree. A good idea would be to take the time to talk to the difficult mums. Remember, Tom, Cris isn’t pure evil, but you can’t let your guard down. The difficult thing is that now she’s got a gun to your head. All you can do is keep calm and carry on - don’t run from the dogs or attack them, just pick up a stick and keep walking.

…Actually it’s not just about keeping calm and carrying on. It’s also about using this to become a better person. That’s the story here. Remember your red letter to yourself? You got to that point because this failure spurred you on. Use your regrets, remember the photo film negatives. You need stoic philosophy to get you through this, and then that will help you get through anything. You have to be truly brave here. A problem is a chance to do your best.

2020

Started work on “when you wish” with the kids. Just the troms, just the trumpets, then just Katarina. Great to be getting them reading, counting and playing in harmony. Have to admit to being more than a little bit proud of the arrangement. Write more.

Amazing how much you can learn in a year: Cris as Executive Director? But also amazing how far you have come in this respect: you now have a good executive producer in Pat, 2 good production assistants in Carol and Iris, communications coordinator in Maria Carolina, and a full teaching staff that can basically do the lessons without you. Once a week just to work on theory, impro etc. and tidy up the new tune is fine. That day when Jim Trott visited the lessons and commented on how you really are on your own was a bit of a wake up call - would be great to send him a video of the lessons now with everything running without you.

The big difference is that you now have Thamires and the chalet in Engenho do Mato. Life after the favela has now taken a very concrete form and there’s no going back. You’ve been writing less diaries because you’ve been living more - you have someone to share things with now. Time off isn’t spent wondering what to do with the time off - you’re at the beach, sharing BBQs, even just watching TV together. And the vision in terms of where all this is going for you is more pratical: you don’t suddenly hand over the reigns to another executive director and expect to be able to hide in the music part and everything be alright, or leave Favela Brass altogether. Rather, it’s a case of getting the thing running more or less smoothly and gradually handing tasks off to trusted staff across all areas. Going from head cook and bottle washer, to hands-off boss, to what you always wanted to be: (paid) arranger.

2022

Last year’s diary a bit of a hammer blow. But anyway…

If I have this right I think today may be a bit of a red letter day. I think I have finally seen the way out of this (and I really wasn’t seeing one before). You don’t farm out the teaching and leave the Favela - that way is expensive as hell and who, realistically, is going to be able/willing to take over at the assunção. It’s strange.

Walking back down from jogging up past CEAT it hit me - you stay in the favela, but you just offload the executive director responsibilities, and gradually more and more of the teaching. You end up giving lessons in the favela in the evenings, doing shows, making course materials, overseeing the teaching, that’s it. No more bullshit from the parents, no more bullshit from Camila, no more bullshit from the board. As Kenny said, the music is the fun bit.

Big question is who takes over as executive diretor but surely Cris would be favorite as she wouldn’t take it in the wrong direction. Could do a trial year, starting with the new Rouanet cycle in March. The board may wish to widen the search, and that would be fine as well.

Point is you’re doing 2 jobs - executive director and teacher - and it’s holding the project back on both fronts. You want to be creating content, not dealing with people problems - leave that to people who relish that kind of work. You’ll have time for Brassify and Tube Map Scales and whatever you else create. You’ll be positioning yourself for other opportunities, the next project.

And yes, at some point maybe you’ll work out how to farm out the teaching at the assunção and head off full tilt on the next adventure, but you’ll do that knowing that Favela Brass is well and truly set up. There’s much more on the music side that has to be you than on the admin side, so you should leave that till last. You leaving the favela and/or not doing lessons at the assunção would derail the project.

You were feeling trapped because in the favela you’re too up close and personal with the parents etc. but as artistic director it’s a bit different. They just won’t deal as much with you. You make clear that you’re just teaching and it takes the pressure off. That way you keep the house and never fall out with the favela. It gradually just morphs away from being your project. That’s the point, it stops being your project.

But seriously, how cool would that be? - no more board meetings or committee meetings, no more Whatsapp groups. Cris for dealing with people and Raissa for actually getting the admin done. Fátima still around for the experience. 

Would also open up the possibility of a bit of work at the British School if you wanted it and the odd extended leave. By leaving slowly you avoid the whole thing collapsing when you have to leave suddenly at some point, of you choosing between being trapped or betraying the project, your students, the favela.

Demoting yourself will reduce the jealousy and in a strange way put you in the driving seat. Now Cris can’t blame all the difficult decisions on you. She takes the heat and you’re just the one that they’re all dependent on for holding things together musically. And you don’t have to worry too much because you’re not trapped - once the ED role is filled and things are rolling without you on the admin side, you’re already on the off-ramp. Really, the problem is getting someone decent to accept the ED role, and the board to accept a different ED.

Damn, it’s not far off: work on materials in the day then test them on the kids at night. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday  Sunday nights free. If and when one day you have kids you could even go as low as one night a week in the favela plus shows and you live where you want. The whole Tube Map Scales thing is so fun: this is where you’re at - Brassify can be even more rewarding, and really is right on your purpose. You need to carve time to get going on these things.

Me as the director of a big project living in the favela isn’t sustainable. But you change the first part of that rather than the second. You could even at some point put yourself as just musical director in the Pereira unidade. 

And with the ED role taken it’s much easier to take an offer abroad - every week the course materials get stronger and it’s easier for the lessons to run without you.

When Jim Trott came round it was a moment of clarity - you’re not an executive director if you’re taking the band. You have to go one way or the other, and it’s becoming pretty clear which one suits your talents most.

I think move more quickly on this. Next March - could make it a trial year. Talk about it in the upcoming strategy meeting. Just thinking about this took a huge weight off. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel now.

2021

It’s still there. Imagine yourself as Dad, knowing you’re on your last legs, sitting waiting for your favorite son to tell you that he’s off back to Brazil - that he can’t wait around for you to die. As he said, it’s so painful. Nobody deserves that.

Waking up a bit hung over again. Was your birthday weekend though. Samba with samba de lei trio in Santa last night was fun on euphonium - more fun than trombone. Thinking about getting them to galinhao for a feijoada na lenha event.

Barbecue in the afternoon at Hedi’s was ok except Janaína hounded me about the social project she wants to do - with our kids, obviously.

Dinner at Bobbie Roberts’ house with John and Mary yesterday. Turned up with just a box of chocolates to John’s bouquet of flowers from M&S. This is the second case of turning up without enough gifts recently. Learn this lesson, you know this already. Ended up an OK evening, but got boring at the end listening to Bobbie and Mary, both ex-nurses, going on about DRI stuff. Said a couple of things that shouldn’t have - that I wouldn’t say anything if my instrument was stolen for fear of reprisals, and going too much into details about my great grandad and Vaughn Williams’ wife. Next time have to do something for Bobbie to avoid being a Joe.

Today is the day to talk to Carola. Think about what you want from this conversation. If you’re not going to fire her, then what are you trying to achieve? You want to set up her writing our Rouanet with reference to Ed’s, and in some way cover yourself for the impending firing, or halfing salary, or whatever. You have to be seen to be fair.

Piano practice - enjoying the Tchaikovsky and this new red/blue deck system. Beer with Biglad and Ellis at Sal. Solid rain forecast for Teresopolis bloody hell. Finished FGN arrangement of Afro Blue. Doing random words on Tinder. The whole world seems to have omicron. Carnaval de rua 2022 cancelled officially but let’s see. 

2021

Has it really been 5 days since I did a diary? Things have very much settled into a rough rhythm: run first thing, then practice piano, 2 sets of arranging/recording (75 mins/60 mins but usually extends), then lunch, nap and do admin. Have started drinking in the evening working up to 2/3 of a bottle of wine tonight...

The UK is going into a full-on lockdown because of this new variant but I should still be able to get back into Brazil, assuming everything goes ok with the PCR test timings. As has been the case a lot this last year, meeting lots of great girls through tinder but COVID making it difficult to move things on.

Looking to clean up the act a bit when I get back to Rio. Stop the boozing till carnaval dates and maybe cut down the caffeine as well. Meditation, exercise etc.

I also discovered something important about trumpet practice: it’s all about consistency. Total consistency. Just 30 mins a day and you can be just about hitting top Fs. BUT it has to be every day every day every day. It’s not about the days on - it’s about NEVER HAVING A DAY OFF. What other things are like that?

“Sometimes it’s necessary to go a long distance out of the way to come back a short distance directly.”
- Edward Albee

Crap nights sleep last night (woke up 3:30) and a down day. Carlos Santana cancelled benfeitoria and I’m worried it was your newsletter showing the kids doing activities that did it. The title “Favela Brass segue trabalhando mesmo no lockdown” maybe not the best. Anyway, not good news.

Relistening to the art of impossible and it struck me that I fit the description of a creative type from cheeks sent me high very well. The contradictions. Good to realize what you are to position yourself and your work. Creative isn’t bad for being executive director - but you have to be careful to keep your word.

Piano practice feels much better now that I’m zoning in on individual pieces and have a Trello scorecard.

Ok so let’s do the first gratitude practice. 3 things I’m grateful for: 1. Being able to get up into nature. 2. Having eggs and toasted rolls with butter in the morning. 3. Having Joe and Amelia living here with me rather than being on my own.

Expand on 3: it gets grim on your own sometimes and you lose perspective. Joe and Amelia are both happy upbeat people who are enthusiastic about YOUR project and here living in a favela in the middle of Rio de Janeiro to help out. How cool is that? You have likeminded musician friends and allies at home be thankful for that (it isn’t always like that).

Off to Teresópolis today. Just packed Zola off to her creche. Expensive but if it works out it’s a solution for getting to the UK next year.

Asked Mum to borrow £5,000 to £10,000 to renovate the top floor of the house. Not ideal, but you could pay back in a pre-determined way sending her the rent from your other house (if you sell it then you’ll have the cash to pay Mum back all at once).

2023

**Christmas Past**

You grew up a star student, with a great talent for music. A bit of a loner, and shy with girls, but that helped with the practice time. Found a solid group of friends in the Doncaster Youth Jazz Orchestra and had some great experiences doing shows and foreign trips. Enjoyed economics at school and ended up studying Management rather than music at uni. Dreams of being an investment banker during the day and Groove Armada by night.

From uni onwards was a bit of a lost period. You got gigs with the Squadronnaires and some live PA stuff, but it was a time marked by loneliness and a lack of professional success. However many months it was at Uncle Paul’s working on an electronic music album that never happened, then a couple more years in Manchester living alone trying to find the lost chord, then about 4 years in London with grand projects including starting a big band, which never amounted to anything. Not taking the plunge with girls lead to getting even more behind on that front.

By the end you were turning into a bit of a weirdo, living in that depressing shared house in Wembley, getting so het up about little things like house cleaning rotas and bigger things, like having frittered an inheritance, that the low point was you having a panic attack. Another daft project, to save live music by moving to Rio de Janeiro and starting a big band, led you to sell everything and buy tickets to Brazil (not without trying to chicken out).

On arriving in Rio life improved a lot. Your musical skills were finally put to use in Rodas de Samba, Carnaval etc., and even though the big band didn’t happen a lot of good things did and you really did get a lot closer to what were were searching for all along - live music as a part of popular culture. After a very slow start with the girls, as you entered your 30s you started dating and having longer-term relationships. A succession of gorgeous girls who you wouldn’t have dreamt of before, but you didn’t commit to any of them.

About 4 years in, with you about 32 you moved to a Pereirão and started Favela Brass. A very good cause filling a genuine gap. For about 7 years it was a you+ project, then during lockdown you put a board together and finally cracked the funding thing, allowing you to give up the part-time job that you hated at the British School. In 2022 you successfully executed the first Rouanet project and secured funding for the next. The band got much better and after wasting a lot of time on wacky methodologies you finally got a solid band program going.

**Christmas Present**
**
**
Right now you find yourself pulled in different directions. The founder period of Favela Brass is well and truly over and now it’s a management job, which doesn’t seem to suit your skill set. It’s all cut-throat politics and tricky decisions, rather than teaching and arranging. Living in the Favela where you work seems more claustrophobic every day and the idea of raising kids there becomes ever less attractive. You want out of the admin side at the very least and now the money is here it looks like you have a chance to do it gracefully.

Post-Talita the dating situation has been slow, and time seems to be catching up with you. 43 is old to be dating, and even if you met Mrs Right (who doesn’t exist) tomorrow, you would be running after kids in your late 40s and probably into your 50s. Work has been so intense that it really has been difficult to spend time going out and meeting new people. However, living in Pereira and being with Favela Brass is still streets ahead of how life was in the lost years before Brazil. You have status and friends here, a reasonable income and a respectable, useful job with responsibility.

Losing Dad in 2021 was a huge blow which threw many things into sharp relief - mainly that you didn’t get on with life in the sense of having a family. He never got to meet his grandchildren on your side, never got to go to your wedding, or see you provide a solid home for your children. After all the tilting at windmills, you didn’t hit the basics and those foundational shortcomings are coming home to roost. Mum is also on her own now and Oli’s already overwhelmed with his own family, which makes it seem increasingly tricky to leave her on her own as time goes on - the other thing you learned from Dad’s death is that you need to start thinking about other people for once.
**
**
Many people end up in much worse places at 43 and if you died tomorrow, you have done something with your life: Favela Brass. Cherry’s done, now for the cake.
**
**
**Christmas Future**

Criteria:

1. Finding a girl 
2. Looking after Mum
3. Getting back to music / arranging
4. Brassifying the world
5. Supporting/raising a family

Mum Options:
1. Moving back to Donny in 5-10 years.
2. Moving somewhere closer to Donny. Even Paris (Eurostar) or Portugal (Manchester Airport).

Let’s have some fun. This is what is in the back of your mind: a 1-year project involving lots of European cities. You could take a Brazilian girl with you. Imagine you are backpacking. Donny, Paris, Lyon, Berlin (Roman), London, Manchester, Rome (Alberto), Madrid (Joe), Washington DC (Joe), 

Have to find a manager for each of the bands - the musos won’t keep it going. And what about the unis thing? That could work in the UK as well.

Everything takes longer than planned 

Think positive! What do you need to start a band? One musician from the city who knows other musicians who are good and interested, and a place to play. Money to pay for rehearsals.

You could get a Brazilian to live with you in Portugal, and it wouldn’t be the end of the world. If it was a French girl you could live in Paris. I think you could pull a French girl. Could you try a year in Paris?

Number 2 means that in about 7-10 years you’ll have to move back to Donny, or close enough to visit regularly. Now, if you find a girl and stay in Brazil

Mum moving to Sunderland won’t work because Oil’s got too much on his plate already, and she needs to be near her friends.

You could do Brazil in the school holidays, that’s something.

That means kids going to school in South Yorkshire unless you see another plan. Think about Nanny Roo - she was unhappy on her own and had to move in with Mum or Charlotte later on. You could maybe just live close i.e. Sheffield.

So you need a girl who’s willing to move to Donny or Sheffield. And you need to think about how you could construct a life worth living there, as Mum inevitably marches on towards 95 (by which time you will be 68). 

Could you live in Donny and travel lots to make it bearable? Not really with small kids. Also travelling up to Donny frequently with a young family would be tiring. Oh Christ.

***

There’s the *grass is greener* effect at work here 

…

So what could satisfy all that lot?

Stay in Rio and tough it out till you find a lady

…

Brassify:

The next project idea is here, but is it a good one? Yes, doing the arrangements is practical, starting a band is doable (providing you get the workload down at Favela Brass). But where is this going?

Where do you want to get to with this?

You getting paid to write brass band arrangements for a bunch of bands around the world.

Bad outcome:

You get the arrangements done and the band sounds ok but you can’t really find a way to pay good musicians, let alone yourself. A bunch of decent videos of arrangements on Youtube don’t really attract much attention. It’s just another fanfarra, another project that doesn’t get off the ground.

Good outcome:

The band in Rio is a hit and you manage to set them up as a going concern. You then take it to other cities where you set up even better bands who rock it. More and more bands start using your arrangements. Slow work, but eventually you start getting in demand as an arranger and musical director.

Rouanet

This is a project that could be approved in Rouanet. At least the band part.

End of Paris holiday. Had a lovely week with inspiring art, food and some nice catch-ups with Dzaritmik and Emile. Nice to be with Val and Hardy again. Dreamt about moving here one day, though conscious that you’re a bit long in the tooth to be starting again from zero.

Mum still doing very well for 70, but told you about this married man in the states, which is a bit worrying. Get that she’s dying to get back out there, but this could be a right old mess. As her son, how much can or should you steer her away from this? As you were parting, Hardy told you to look after your Mum - maybe that’s your answer.

Good news is that Rouanet mess is now sorted - now the work begins for 2023. It’s going to be huge, but just imagine how great it would be to have a strong team together by the end of it. You’re really setting the project up now.

Had this idea of trying to get to the point where I can improvise in the 19th century French cornet style.

Burkemann’s thesis is that instrumentalizing our time, especially our leisure time, is a problem. That we need to embrace the fact that we’re just not going to get everything done, therefore we should just chill out and choose something realistic to get done, forgetting the rest. That we’re spoiling our lives by overestimating the importance of what we do with them.

Globo visited Favela Brass yesterday. Didn’t interview well, bunch of kids without T-shirts and didn’t get the kids playing the best repertoire on camera.

2022

Full day of lessons. Discovered the lunch offer at Fagulho’s. Printed out first cards for keeping track of student progress through the grades - decided to include transposition in the end. Bought tickets for show minutes before finding out that Rob has COVID. Very knackered but good knackered at end of day.

2021

Missed a few days of diary there. Summing up - method going well working name practical musicianship. Made a website this weekend for it. Thinking sticking it all up for free and doing a buy me a coffee button might be a good option.

Scared that Melissa has got me in her sights - flirty texts and asking me for a beer. How to not get with the treasurer and not offend her - tricky.

Missed a couple of grants deadlines that I should have hit. This is why having days for certain things is good. Loving this new daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly organization thing.

Had a coffee this morning and kind of span out of control really trying to think of names for the method and coming up with a bad one (the lost music lesson). Ate badly and spent too much time lying down. The magic of transposition? Leave it!

Stugger is leaving DYJO but didn’t answer when I asked him why. It’s not just you. 

I am grateful for the Canadian ice-wine that Amelia brought. I am grateful to Floor for accepting to teach Vinicio flute.

I’m grateful for the little books series - they have pretty much made it possible to set up a (kind of) functioning board for Favela Brass. And the one on nonprofit leadership is excellent as well - work on the project, not in it, then move on (at least from the DE role)

Got laid Saturday and Sunday - how long is it since that happened? Thamires seems like she’d make a great choice only she doesn’t want kids from what she said. Patrícia also nice but not over endowed in the conversation department. Forgot Monique’s birthday today - she even sent you a message yesterday to give you a chance. Must do better.

Dona Maria from next door said she’s not selling the house, so that’s that. Could have been a good move, but I guess we keep looking. More rooms would have helped to house Joe and Amelia and still have a few rooms to stick on Airbnb. Pricing up roofs - Wendel and Antonio seem the most professional so far. New mattresses came today - bloody great.

Did the presentation for PetroRio yesterday and seems like they liked it (“Por nosso parte estamos muito empolgados”). By luck, Fátima got SALIC updated in the nick of time so ostensibly it’s just a case of Mirela going in and opening the account now.

Practicing piano, doing organizing bits (stressing about the 21st) and also went out for a sushi, which was a bit underwhelming although great to get some badly needed fish into the diet. Just can’t help feeling that I should have squeezed more piano in today.

Firming up this decision to give the executive director job to someone else. Not necessarily Cris - could even be Ed Matkin, or Fátima or more likely someone else. We’d have to interview, which would be healthy. Would it be perfect? No. But it would get you out of this corner - and if you don’t like the idea of Cris “winning”, think in terms of it passing a poison chalice, of unloading a heavy burden.

Question now is where are you personally going? Favela Brass thrives as you go from ED to artistic director then volunteer teacher in pereira, then even leave. Great. But what of you and your career and love life?

Brassify is where your heart is now. How can you build around that? How can you make it pay? Where should you be for that?

Having a band to play the charts is a good start. Favela brass can handle some but not all. A pro band could be fun and make a bit of cash. Look at James. Running a band is people and stress, yes, but nothing on a nonprofit. And it’s fun and friends as well.

But that wasn’t the original idea. The idea is to get the charts used by other bands. If you focused you could be spending the morning on arranging each day - imagine how much you would get done each year and how your arranging chops would come on.

Well, 3 years later you didn’t blink with Pam. Good lad - that already feels like the best decision ever. Suddenly work life has stopped being grim, and I’m pretty sure not just for me.

Dan taken ill so I subbed for him at Pereira Passos school today, good fun with the percussion students. Set up pads and printed out drafts of the first 7 Metais Com Charme arrangements. Started recording the trumpets.

Lovely birthday weekend in EDM. The fort with the amazing views, the Malteca cervejaria, Prawn Coconut at Seu Antônio, then the next day beach with Joe and Amelia then joined for bbq at the chalet with Thamires’s Mum and Aunt (first time meeting them), Maria Izabel and Renata (who made up), Thainara from next door Hedi and Janaina.

Hedi only paid R$800 for the previous Curry Clube gig which has really taken the shine off it. Took the first opportunity to notch it down to one this month and may continue like that.

Should have fired her, should have fired her, should have fired her. Had coffee with Carola yesterday and she must have been expecting the worst. Told her why I wasn’t happy and she agreed with everything. Told her that she wasn’t going to be included in Rouanet and established when she’s paid up to. On the plus side a) she’s off Rouanet and moved further to the edges of the project and b) the stage has been set for firing her in November. BUT, you had a good window where nobody could really complain. You blinked.

2025

Quite a big day today. Started off practicing piano and writing music for the first time in your new studio. Getting up at 4:30 seems to be the way forward: piano first, then an hour of arranging, then running with Zola. Gives you more chance of getting piano and arranging done most days, and also means you do your writing while the tea is still coursing through your veins.

Also thought more about doing original tunes for Cacilda. The students liked the Afro-groove of Coisa no.4 so trying to come up with something along those lines.

Then… came up with the Street Brass World Cup name. The idea clicked that a competition is at the heart of a lot of movements. Remember the Micheal Jackson beer guide setting of the craft beer movement? UK brass bands, pretty much all sports, samba schools etc. etc.

Cell phone broken. Maybe that’s why you’re having ideas.

2024

10 years of Favela Brass at Circo Voador with 10 guest bands. About 1.000 people there in all including artists, team etc. All went remarkably smoothly and couldn’t think of a better way to mark 10 years of Favela Brass.

2022

Another day working straight through ending with finance meeting and sorting stuff with Cris. It’s a tunnel.

2021

Finance meeting not ideal. Despite Sômulo making clear that he wanted the presidency, Mirela took it, despite having said she hasn’t got the time or the experience. It’s a curve ball, might be ok let’s see.

Let’s get to that gratitude practice. I’m grateful for being able to have fun chatting to extremely hot girls on Tinder, for being able to buy great ingredients for cheap and have them come straight to the door. 

I’m very grateful indeed for the opportunity to work with kids like Maria Rita, as in the lesson today, where she said she had been practicing every day. You have a fantastic life purpose and a cause to work your ass off for every day. Be thankful for that blessing. It’s huge and most people don’t have that.

Good chat with Fatima today. I do think we’re going to get a fair bit of funding. Working into evenings with this stuff with a beer watching that Richard Ayoardi travel show.

The Happiness Trap is great for you. One interesting idea is not to thing about achieving your goals, but by living your values. Goals just give way to other goals, whereas you can live your values today. From Dad’s last weeks you learned that goals should give way to values.

Yesterday T2 played for the inaugural school lesson at CIEP. Tallied the final exams results - some inconsistencies there, which takes away from their usefulness. Rang references for Dani and Pamela, getting to the conclusion that Dani wouldn’t stay with us - she’s all about the theatre. First Airbnb guest after Amelia leaving, Theresa, seems to be enjoying but baby Joe won’t practice in the practice room because he says it’s too hot. Going to put in air conditioning which will be good to have anyway.

Thinking more and more that Rio is still the place to be: nowhere on earth with better audiences for brass band music, and you have a good setup. Just need to make time for writing arrangements.

2022

Productive day on the course materials side of things. Thinking through how to make life simpler with the reading exercises/repertoire/grade tests etc. Made the first tune transposition tube map which looks great, and did an arrangement of Anita’s boys don’t cry which I think is a winner. Should have done it 2 weeks ago though.

2021

Lovely day recording mamãe eu quero with school kids at Praia do Flamengo. Yesterday you nailed too much coffee with the intention of writing music but it didn’t actually happen. To be fair you got quite a bit of admin done late on, but tea is by far the better vibe. You also drank a bit of coffee today as well as pizza and beers at Hedi’s. Result: you’re a bit tight. May be difficult to sleep tonight. 

Lessons on Sundays at Praia do Flamengo for the school kids looks like the way forward. Today was only marred really by mangueirinha taking a group shot of him with the kids and then posting in the group and on social media. Took it down off Instagram but it’s still there on Facebook despite me sending a message. Also, mangueirinha couldn’t play surdo to the metronome today which wasted and will waste loads of time. Remember: he’s not loyal, just like Carola and Stugger. Watch your back!

Today, speaking with Cris, you decided that it would be better to offer transport to the parents after all to go to the Aterro. The event is 8 days out. Pam went absolutely nuts, and is trying to Kaibosh it, saying that she doesn’t have budget. 

A few days back in the supermarket in Engenho do Mato I looked at the girl on the till at the supermarket and thought about how good it would be to have a job that you didn’t take home with you. Since then that thought has come back, the idea that the main thing that stops your job being like that is you: you have to try to leave all that favela brass stuff behind when you’re not working - make a point of being slightly irresponsible in almost pretending it doesn’t exist.

Thank God I didn’t have a beer last night. Was at work by 4:30 this morning and by 9am had done 8 pomodoros of great work as well as coming up with the name, Gabarito.com and making the link between partimento, harmonization and this system. 8 pomodoros and 24 mins each trumpet and piano is a heck of a salvo to fire off before 9am. Can you keep it up?

I am grateful that I live in a country where there is an abundance of beautiful women who love music. I am grateful that I live in a country where the local currency is cheap so that when pounds or dollars come in they go a long way in terms of travel (by the way maybe you should travel in Brazil to fall back in love with it)

I am grateful for being committed to Favela Brass. You could spend your whole life flitting if you’re not careful. In your teens you decided that even though you weren’t just about trumpet, that getting really good at it was the best thing you could do to move yourself in the right direction. That worked and now as then, although you’re not sure exactly what you want to be doing in 10 years time, for whatever that is, it’s vital that you make Favela Brass a roaring success. You have to get these kids playing well. The bridges are burned. Good. Get on with it!

You were a prick this morning with Raissa, talking about the relatório anual. Yes as leader you can assert yourself, but don’t be a dick. Favela Brass admin all day - in the initial moment with Pamela and Viviane. It just comes from all sides. Settled on Wendel for the roof, bought new mattresses for the house, managed to stop yourself buying Yamaha hi-fi speakers. Monique wants to talk it’s sad - can’t she see that there’s nothing coming from my side?

“Mas eu vou vencer. Se eu não morrer”

Coffee didn’t work. It’s just too much. You need to be in charge of your emotions. Notch down to tea and then think about notching down further. The chasing impossible book talks about oxytocin and the way you are on coffee isn’t going to help you to get the oxytocin flowing in the team (or yourself).

What does get the oxytocin flowing? Real stuff. Genuine ideals. Not Stugger playing trombone for Dad’s 90th. Genuine stuff. You being your best self, the self that wrote the red card. The self that sat down on the steps after the Olympics. You on meditation.

If you’re going to have a problem it’s not going to be because you weren’t wired enough in the morning: it will be because you were too wired the rest of the day and zombified in the evening. Not a good idea to be falling out with people: Angelo, Marcia, Mangueirinha, Stugger, parents, Joe - you just can’t piss all of them off.

A cool person is someone that people want to be around. Relaxed, happy, fun, firm in a friendly way when needed, with strong boundaries.

A year on and Sômulo still being a prick. Geiza apparently has been told by a board member that the ideas not to take mothers on trips and not to let the parents meet the board came from me and Cris.

Good news today, Rouanet has advanced to just waiting to be published, Prio have held a volleyball match to raise money for us and Lucia’s Mum is letting her back in the project (although Marquinho wasn’t happy about that). Fatima has let up about misturando marcas and it looks like it will be possible to throw Rouanet, ICMS and foca together if need be.

Had a nice churrasco just me and Joe yesterday but Joe tested positive for COVID today and I’m feeling under the weather. Set Serragrande and Manguerinha off at the assuncao then headed back home.

BCS Beatles night on Sat was interesting - Neville being total diva and Steve Rimmer swearing on the mic. It’s good contacts but I think you’ve done your bit now. Zezo and head Dan from Barra still talking about band programs but it sounds like a lot of work and it would still be Zezo’s show.

Got off with Jhennifer after the baile and shortly afterwards was confirmed that she has a boyfriend. Awkward, but I think it will settle.

After first day doing FB at the aterro in the morning and ADC at night ended up getting a hotel in Lapa and crashing. Drank too much coffee with the hotel breakfast this morning and it messed with the social equilibrium during the day.

Anyway main news: PetroRio have pre approved the full Rouanet amount. Sômulo was chewing me out during the day about our materiais again, trying to position it that if we didn’t get it, it was my fault for not having an annual report to download on the site.

Cold turkey day as I try to give up caffeine (and booze) till tchutchuca is born. Yesterday notched it down by drinking tea instead of coffee and felt some emotions that I haven’t felt for a while whilst watching *A Man Called Otto* - it was a fairly cheesy movie but got your cockles going in parts. It’s that that you miss - the goosebumps, the inspiration.

2023

Did video with my band at Hedi’s yesterday. Gig was great musically but not many punters.

Don’t forget this idea: You write for Favela Brass big band, then find music schools abroad (DYJO, Dan Swana etc.) that will pay you to adapt them for standard big band. Putting your recordings of the FB version on the Favela Brass channel will boost visibility and ingrain this idea of the arranger being a central budget line item for Favela Brass. Favela Brass pay you to do their arrangements (including the recordings) and put links to arrangeme on the curriculum and Youtube vids, and other music schools pay you to adapt for big band - a group of schools could share this cost out.

No reason that all this can’t go out as Brassify as well

Just struck me that this whole activist street band movement thing is a reflection of the times. People are so narcissistic that they don’t want to see other people play - they want to play themselves and even though they are shit, delude themselves that they are actually superheroes on a super important social mission. When really all they want is attention and status.

Cris is highly highly political. Wanting to give flowers to Mirela and Diane and give special notes out at the Christmas event to certain participants, including the board. Remember how she kissed up to you, and sometimes still does? Quem puxa o saco puxa o tapete também. Nobody joins the conselho das mães if they don’t like politics and the dynamics of power.

The other thing about Cris, but also with other people like Stugger, is that they aren’t afraid to do things that you are afraid to do. Like cutting you out of the loops for things, not asking for permission etc. You need to test the limits more with this. Stop tiptoeing around people. Yes aggression is bad - but maybe if you were the one who wasn’t afraid about stepping on people’s toes, then you wouldn’t have all this resentment building.

Treat Cris, Mangueirinha, Sômulo and the rest as worthy competitors in a game with no rules.

Honestly, I think you need to channel your slightly psycho dark side.

Monique is growing on me. Doesn’t seem to get in moods - dragged her out for lunch straight off a 9 hour flight with no shower and she was still smiling away. There is no such thing as a perfect woman.

Dad very much in thoughts. Just the sadness of missing him this time - saudades I guess. And a guilt for not having got down to business and had a family while he was alive. You only thought of yourself.

Last night in UK - it has been a really nice month, got plenty done, great to see the folks. Taking 4 trombones back with me including the bass trombone which arrived today and the price of which (625 quid plus 40 for Keith to fix and 16 postage) makes me cringe a little. Anyway, you now have a bass trombone and can record the full big band.

Made prawn, scallops and calamari curry for the folks which turned out ok. Also taking large amounts of loose-leaf tea back with me, and lots of music books including time pieces books for putting classical repertoire in our grades, theory workbooks and past papers, and the Faber jazz piano book. 

Dug in and did the 30 mins trumpet today even though it could have been easy to leave it - you have learned your lesson. It has to be 30 mins without exception EVER.

Spoke to Joe Howson today, who has COVID but is fine. He liked the idea of giving support to our volunteers. Sounds like Beth is not well at all with kidneys only running at 70%.

Had a good finance meeting with Melissa and Sômulo yesterday and Joe and Amelia will get the Patreon money for now.

Persuaded Mum to buy a new MacBook Air and gave her £150 for her old one which solves the Sibelius problem. The new MacBook Air with new Apple chips is supposed to be amazing so works out well for us all. 

Had a long run the other day on the way to pick up fish and chips from Whitby’s and the running form really came back - no problem striding it out for extended periods. Would love to get back running back Rio - let’s see what the feet say.

On the annoying side Lana Santos was asking about the Boticário comercial. Reading between the lines I think Aline thinks we screwed her over and got paid by Boticário for the clip. Which couldn’t be further from the truth: we weren’t part of the commercial, our video never went out on tv, and I got cestas básicas for the parents rather than taking a donation for the project. Maybe best to head this off direct when I get back.

2019

Thinking more seriously about the idea of doing an online iPGCE. With that, your CV starts to look quite good for teaching jobs at international schools. The option of extending it to an MA is also tempting (have to find a way to finance it).

A full-time job at an international school would give you financial security, a good school to send your kids to and also a potential stream of students to join your extra-curricular programs. Indeed, what makes this seem like a viable option is the idea that Favela Brass is moving towards the idea of a 2:30pm - 5:30pm extracurricular band program at CIEP. No reason why private school students couldn’t be a (paying) part of that, or why you couldn’t do the same thing for TBS students on Tuesdays & Thursdays.

Yes, it would mean a lot of time giving lessons for rich kids and less “free” time for self-development. But remember that all teachers have free periods and all you would have to do is buy a laptop. The melodica lessons that currently happen at 12H and 14:30H could be covered by other teachers, so you would be looking at 7:30 - 15H in the schools, followed by 15:30-17:30 at CIEP, then maybe 18:30 - 20:30 in the favela. It’s a lot, but remember all the public holidays, lost days and the fact that it all stops for July and January.

David Brennan made a point about doing things while you have time. At the moment you don’t have kids or a wife - that may not always be the case. It does seem like a good time to do this. Sometimes you just have to move in the right general direction. Take Talita’s advice: get yourself qualified.

Listening to “The Antidote” got me thinking. Imagine you are o seeing yourself (and, crucially, everyone else) in some kind of a miniature live board game. What is different about seeing life from this perspective? What differences does this make in the way you would act? How you experience life?

It’s all in the ego and the self. That detachment makes for a much healthier way of seeing yourself and others. You are still charged with controlling your “character”, still rooting for you, still wanting you to have fun. But makes things a bit less personal. You’re more resilient.

At certain time you will be inescapably drawn into your character’s first-person perspective. When you are playing well, this will be in moments of inspiration, flow  and connection. When things aren’t going so well it will be in moments of anger, pain and rumination.

Ah, and a less profound insight. Over exercising reliably makes you feel much better.

Weekend they come to you. Non-exclusive groups would be good so they can be playing Saturday and Sunday if they want.

2021

On the plane back to Rio via Paris now. Time to think about the upcoming year…

**2021 WIGs**
If you were only allowed 2 WIGs for 2021 what would they be? I would say number 1 create and record a big band repertoire and number 2 get a massive melodica program going in the schools. There are other things, like sorting the syllabus and exams, but these are the 2 things that would make the most difference. Why?

**WIG 1: Big Band Arrangements**
These arrangements are the mission statement of the project. Get these done and you have thrown the gauntlet down for what we want to achieve. Doing the videos with the kids during lockdown is ideal for keeping both the kids’ energy up (and challenging them) and also having stuff to share on social media. The arrangements also open the door for international exchange collaborations and collaborations with famous artists. Staff will get a bit of glory.

If you get a decent book together this year (42 pearlers?) then 2022 can be about getting stuff played weekly by students, staff exchange partners, pro musician friends, adult students etc…  hopefully down at the coreto moderno on Sundays. You will learn loads from making the recordings in terms of arranging and also playing the individual instruments.

**WIG 2: Mass Melodica Participation.**
The limiting factor at the moment is the quality and quantity of our students. We have great volunteer teachers, we have instruments coming out of our ears, what we don’t have is a decent-sized waiting list of students that are hungry to learn and will practice at home. If we want to have a generation of great musicians coming out of the project in 8-10 years time, then we have to sow the seeds now. Only a small proportion of students will complete melodica and recorder karate, we know that, so we need to cast the net very wide. 

If 1 in 10 of the 1500 kids in our schools now achieved that during 2021 we would have a bumper year to get our Rouanet money invested in. Imagine if in 2022 every one of our schools had an extra-curricular music program with melodica/recorder, percussion, and graded group wind instrument sessions. Open bloco rehearsals at Praça São Salvador on Saturdays and Praia do Flamengo Sundays before big band will work well with larger groups - remember being in an empty Quadra at CIEP? It’s all about big mo so let’s go!

**2021 Habits**
Last year was a lot about assuming the role of Executive Director, not being a perfectionist and generally getting to grips with the management aspect. With lockdown you established the solid 30 mins of trumpet and piano daily, and towards the end of the year read the work clean book from which first the main wildly important new habit for 2021 comes: the daily meeze. The second WIH is a 75-minute writing big-band arrangement writing session followed by a 30 minute recording session.

Typical day:
6H up, meditate, exercise, brekky, tea!
8H Meeze
8:30 Writing session
9:45 Tea Break
10H Recording
10:30 Piano
11H Last tea and hit the list!

**WIH 1: Daily Meeze**
The reason for the daily meeze is that we want this year to be the year of getting organised. You have always wanted to be on top of things, to feel on top of things. The Meeze is the way to do that because it means you get the things done that need to be done. It’s the difference between being organised and not being organised. The difference between being someone with lists and someone without lists. And.. it’s a new habit which will mean you will feel a real difference.

**WIH 2: Big Band Arranging**
This is your deep work for the day and it’s your creative product at the end of the year. Imagine that: a big band book with recordings of all the tunes and videos of the best ones including some of the kids and a variety of other guest appearances. We can push the deadline till the end of your Christmas break next year so that you get the last month of recording at home.

Think about it: it’s like you’re releasing multiple albums - you have never released anything creatively before now. Finished product. And it’s bang on your wider mission with the potential to expand your impact way beyond Rio. Stay on this, just this. Your weakness is that you have good ideas but don’t see them through. This year you’re seeing this through.

House nearly ready, Thiago nearly ready. Still with this idea of the Taça das Fanfarras / Street Brass World Cup - just need to work out whether to do it under the Favela Brass umbrella or not. Yesterday Cacilda voted unanimously to put Bárbara in the band.

Writing the first original tune and it feels like when you did that first arrangement of “Boys don’t cry”

A day off - almost. Down to feira in bairro da Fátima, bought ingredients for curry. Invited Fernanda from São João de Meriti an unfortunately she came dressed like a whore. Not good. Still, was a relaxing afternoon and the maple syrup pancakes were a treat.

Mate I reckon you need to up your age limit to a strict 23 absolute minimum.

Bank of Brasil being monumentally sh*t. 9 days into the month and still haven’t been able to pay people. It’s hard to get the best from people when you’re being funny with the money.

2021

I’m grateful for having a loving, supporting, cultured, musical, good, unbroken family. I’m grateful for my amazing house with stunning view of yellowy sunrise this morning.

I’m grateful for the gift of my own intelligence. Whatever bum cards nature dealt you, you got it where it counts. It’s the number one thing for human beans and it means you are capable of amazing things if you manage to get your ducks in a row. Really, thank your lucky stars.

The flow exercises are paying off. Virtuous circle happening with meditation starting to come into it, then practicing your weaknesses (which is really good keep this going). Haven’t drunk for a couple of weeks either.

Doing these 8-to-a-grade Folhas and tested trombone ones with Nathan and Henri and they worked a treat. Thinking along the lines that if different music projects and schools could only agree to a given standard for each colored fita, that would be a great thing for Brazilian music Ed in itself. That would be a great legacy - to bring music grades to Brazil.

Picked up Zola this week at the dog clinic in Teresópolis. She was very shy at first, trembling in the clinic, didn’t want to walk around on the lead when we got to Margo’s. But a few days in at home in Niteroi and she’s settling in well. Such a huge difference having her around, just getting started on the dog training. Last night sat by the pool with her in your lap and thanked your lucky stars.

Teresópolis with banda 2 and banda 3. Amazing day at Margo and Judi’s yesterday. Kids were in paradise. The custom wine-bottle presents went down very well indeed. Met Peter, Liz, Bárbara (?), and someone else. 

Gained some traction talking to Irmã Nadia about the possibility of us renting the Colégio Assunção. Cláudio from Teresópolis definitely helping with this. Maybe best just to get a foot in the door with monthly rent (monthly rent party?)

Had flu for the duration of the trip which didn’t help with your energy with other people. Need to stay healthy so that you can maintain a sense of humour at all times.

Sneaky suspicion that Shanso and Iris went out in the woods in the morning - they definitely went off to the river at Margo’s. Delicate situation - live and let live, but the last thing we want is gossip about people sneaking out and shagging.

By coincidence I thought roughly the same thing again today: « please make it go away » - that was after a rambling board meeting about new directors where we really didn’t get anywhere (after a day of admin, Saara and with the Super Baile Brass looming). Really sat there in the meeting and thought « I just do no want to be here ». How great would it be not to be the ED - and how much better could someone else do the job?

Struck by the humanity in the photo of the Turkish guy holding the hand of his 15 year-old daughter under the rubble. Humanity. Being human. Isn’t that what it comes down to? Isn’t that what you need to cultivate?

2022

Another non-stop, please make it stop day. Luuk Hof over for lunch. Cancelled the lesson because it was raining on and off. Wish I hadn’t so we could have got cracking on the Anita arrangement.

Yesterday, after ringing me outright Bindu left a long audio message which after 2 minutes finally came to the point: she wants to put her produtora friend on the board. Happy happy joy joy. Someone to beat me over the head with.

Played “La Cloche Sonne” for the first time tonight and it made me think of the inexorable clock that’s ticking for all of us. This is your midlife time - where what had heretofore been a distant spectre starts to become a tangible figure, coming into sharper focus by the year. The regrets also start to take a more solid form, as more and more of the irreversibles start to pile up and bother you:

2021

Beware Stugger. Though he was your best friend for a long time and has been very supportive of the project, you cannot ignore the signs that you can’t trust him. Remember the terrible impact that Carola had, working behind the scenes, and bear in mind that they, coincidentally, ended up together (essentially against you). Remember how he left you for dead on last day of the coast to coast walk, his little comment to Sally at Carnaval, the latent hate that spilled out with the failed UK trip, and his “Amelia is going to hate you after this” slip. Remember him taking the Matt Dabbs donation and not even telling you, putting up an ad for instruments for “Favela Brass and Gracie’s school”, and remember him quietly not mentioning Rob Egerton’s instrument donation.

In Robert Greene terms you have to wake up to this and, without overreacting, manage the situation. What decisions can you take now to limit the damage Stu’s ego can cause? It’s two-pronged really - you have to keep him sweet, and you have to keep him at a distance. Keeping him sweet means bending a little bit, buttering him up, massaging that raging ego. Keeping him at a distance means not asking him, NYBB or DYJO for help with anything (OK you can borrow a Bari sax from Stu Macdonald!), letting the board members know the situation in an indirect way, and also arranging other, better, exchanges and exchange partners - take the initiative and forge other, less complicated partnerships.

He definitely has shades of the “Relentless Rebel” outlined below, and this explains his slightly conflicted attitude to you. In some ways you embody this rebel attitude - rejecting a possible career in financial services to create an independent project in a favela. He wants to be a part of this and he genuinely wants to support the cause. But he is also becomes a simmering cauldron of resentment at the first sign of any successful authority on your part. He wants to build you up, but he also wants to tear you down - just as he wanted to tear down Dennis Rollins, Cast, DYJO’s secretary, their ex-treasurer, and the board as a whole if they dare to question him.

The thing is to take other initiatives that don’t involve Stugger. Dilute his influence. Look elsewhere. Make videos with other projects, lay the groundwork for other exchanges. Raise money elsewhere. And keep him away from the others - he won’t be able to bear you gaining their respect. Also, work on those that he might infect. If he recruits help for us make sure that you thank them profusely at the time and remember them afterwards - don’t hand him the opportunity. Rob Egerton, Sam Thornton, NYBB, Encontro. You must protect your reputation from attack.
 
It seems sad to be writing all this about a friend, but there is also a certain sense of relief in looking at this objectively. Who knows, if you get it right then maybe you two will be able to relax and enjoy a beer at Carnival.

**The Arrogant and Proud Man:**

Although he may initially disguise it, this man’s touchy pride makes him very dangerous. Any perceived slight will lead to a vengeance of overwhelming violence. You may say to yourself, “But I only said such-and-such at a party, where everyone was drunk. . . .” It does not matter. There is no sanity behind his overreaction, so do not waste time trying to figure him out. ***If at any point in your dealings with a person you sense an oversensitive and overactive pride, flee. Whatever you are hoping for from him isn’t worth it.***

**The Hopelessly Insecure Man:**
**
**
This man is related to the proud and arrogant type, but is less violent and harder to spot. His ego is fragile, his sense of self insecure, and if he feels himself deceived or attacked, the hurt will simmer. He will attack you in bites that will take forever to get big enough for you to notice. If you find you have deceived or harmed such a man, disappear for a long time. Do not stay around him or he will nibble you to death.

**From Robert Greene 10 Toxic Types to avoid hiring at any cost:**

**The Relentless Rebel: **
*
*
At first glance such people can seem quite exciting. They hate authority and love the underdog. Almost all of us are secretly attracted to such an attitude; it appeals to the adolescent within us, the desire to snub our nose at the teacher. They don’t recognize rules or precedents. Following conventions is for those who are weak and stodgy. These types will often have a biting sense of humor which they might turn on you, but that is part of their authenticity, their need to deflate everyone, or so you think. But if you happen to associate with this type more closely you will see that is something they cannot control; it is a compulsion to feel superior, not some higher moral quality.

In their childhood a parent or father figure probably disappointed them. They come to mistrust and hate all those in power. In the end, they cannot accept any criticism from others because that reeks of authority. They cannot ever be told what to do. Everything must be on their terms. If you cross them in some way, you will now be painted as the oppressor and be the brunt of their vicious humor. They gain attention with this rebel pose and soon become addicted to the attention. ***In the end it is all about power — no one shall be above them and anyone who dares will pay the price.*** Look at their past history — they will tend to split with people on very bad terms, made worse by their insults. Do not be lured in by the hipness of their rebel pose. Such types are eternally locked in adolescence and to try work with them will prove as productive as trying to lock horns with a sullen teenager.

Baile Brass yesterday with To be Wild and Metais Pesados was lovely. Kids played great, and just such a great interaction with the guest musicians. Felt a bit bad pushing the battle of the bands thing - really did feel like a little bit of a humiliation for the adults. Hiding Cacilda at the beginning was fun too. And coming home to drink cointreau and cream with Thamires was the best possible end to the night.

There’s always something, and it’s Pam at the moment. She’s clearly on a warpath against both you and Cris. She seems to be splitting the team into the pros (her and Sassá, maybe Camila), and the incompetents (you and Cris). She’s trying to lay down the law with you about budgets and generally busting your balls in front of the others at any opportunity.

At this point, her becoming executive director is a bad outcome for you unless you’re going to walk away from Favela Brass completely: but even then, would Favela Brass thrive under her, or would you be back picking up the pieces? Maybe that’s what you do: walk away and let her piss everyone off in your absence. Then come back in and put her in her place, by popular demand. 

Listened to the Robert Green chapter on one-upmanship, because I think the best strategy would be to get Pam to melt down. The problem with firing her is the idea of you being childish and truculent, getting rid of competent people on a whim. Yes, you can make the decision not to hire her next year (or even cut her loose before), but so much better if you are reluctantly letting her go after it becomes clear that she’s driving everyone crazy.

Just looked at the latest torrent of emails and in there is one of her saying that the association has to pick up the tab if we take parents to any gigs, because there’s nothing in Rouanet about transporting parents. I think she thinks that by making you request association money from the diretoria for your silly idea, she’ll make you look like a clown. If you can get Fátima to back you up, this could be a good opportunity for the one-upmanship dynamic to play out: you need to be the one maintaining your cool while she lashes out.

Your weak point is that you don’t want to have to pick up Pam’s responsibilities. And another danger is you and Pam coming before the board like two arguing siblings. A key component is her overplaying her hand: thinking that she can turn the board and staff against you by trash-talking you, so that people come to the conclusion that she’s the problem.

Plan A now should be running the year out, but not hiring her again next year. Options include Sassá as coordenador geral, or someone else with experience with Rouanet. With that in mind you must now:

- Stop the trash-talking of other employees to Pam, or of Pam to other employees.
- Be organised, professional. Respond to the emails. Add value, work hard. Be nice.
- Subtly challenge Pam’s authority and stoke her insecurities when you can - get her to leak all of that contempt and arrogance. 
- Try to get one other person that thinks she should go: Cris would be an obvious choice.
- Work on everyone, but especially Sassá.

The thing with Pam is that she’s willing to pick a fight with anyone: PRIO, you, the diretoria. But she is also competent and organised and people come to rely on that. You need everyone to be feeling drained from her constant pressuring and confrontation - you need everyone counting the days for her to leave.

Try to get inside her head as well - how’s she seeing this? What are her plans? She must be thinking about elbowing you out and firing Cris. How does she go about do that? Make Cris and you look bad in front of everyone, including the diretoria. Make her look good to the diretoria, for example by saving them money. Get to the point where she’s running everything with the staff and the staff want you out of the way.

Dude, you’re going to wake up tomorrow with all this crap hanging over, but just remember that it’s all good learning about human nature, you can only do your best, and keeping a sense of humour is always the best policy.

Today you spent hours sorting out the FB repertoire books: this will help loads. Whatever happens, don’t let all this crap distract you from your music.
 
2021

Just watched the Talented Mr. Ripley. Not comfortable viewing. All about people with terrible secrets. It must be coming. Too many people in the favela know about the thing with the neighbors. You can’t keep this away from the board forever - especially now Bindu is on the case.

All you can do is see if there’s any way to ameliorate things, try and draw a line under it, do your best to make as much positive impact as you can with the project, and live a little of the Brazil dream while it lasts. Might be 40 years might be 40 days, so embrace it. Be nice to people, share lots of smiles and love and music.

This theory of change diagram has taken on an extra dimension. You REALLY WANT to make this change - it’s not just a diagram for a grant. Make something real tomorrow.

All this worry. Pour it into your work. That’s your only hope at redemption. You started favela brass because you were ashamed of yourself. Now make it into a success. Use this. Hard work and humility - nobody can take that away from you. Lose your ego, find your purpose.

Thamires over for BBQ yesterday. She’s so great. Hangover today was worth it although it did interfere with work. Back writing music first thing now and today almost managed the holy trinity today - 90 mins arranging first thing, 30 mins piano, daily dozen on trumpet.

Mum’s birthday, but she moved the zoom call time so we’ll end up talking tomorrow. Just booked in at Flor do Céu with Thamires and going to take her to Sugarloaf as well. That and the Le Creuset dish and you’re going to be spending well over R$1.000. She’s worth it. But you’ve got to be getting a bit more smart with the cash. Let the board pay you more than the rest of the team.

The mums are playing up again - kicking off about the festa junina. This whole thing is either going to drive you nuts or teach you to take life with a pinch of salt. You’ve made the decision to stay in the DE role for the rest of the year. Be a good stoic and put your back into it now - stop looking around.

Didn’t go to the lessons at the Assunção today. That’s a turn-up. As things are you’re only committed to one lesson a week - if you’re in this for the long haul then something has to give.

2022

Mum’s 70th. Cake and schloer and presents in the hotel reception with Oli and Charlotte, then lunch at the Shard and a terrible show later on - the play that goes wrong. Christ that was bad.

Spent a lot of the day stewing because Raissa has put Cris as “produtora de todo o projeto incluindo alocação com parceiros e alunos” or something like that on the Rouanet orçamento. Something tells me you aren’t flavour of the month with  the staff.

As much as you tell yourself it’s just a game etc. this isn’t pleasant. Would letting them push you on to just music be a way out? Or would giving up the ED spot leave you powerless and miserable? Or are you already powerless and miserable?

2021

So in the last couple of days, kind of like the last days of the pandemic for you, you’ve finally had the big idea. And even got the name for it. Yesterday was using simply coloured notation on the staff for the gabaritos (as opposed to a reference at the back of the book). Today was also significant: the idea that the Gabarito isn’t some long scale for looking up the notes - it’s the notes and patterns of the piece condensed as far as possible into a 4 bar phrase which, played in the a given key, sets the scene. Crucially, Katarina had no problem switching between reading off note names and scale degrees. This is big.

Rushed day - didn’t even ring Mum on her birthday. Photographer from Globo came round and got some excellent short of Edileuza and Duda. Running around trying to get as many kids as poss to sign Amelia’a card.

Nice e-mails from Simon Cook.

Kind of packed - still don’t feel confident I have everything under control.

First meeting with Pam, Vivi, Cris and Raissa. Pam did pretty well, but speaking very quietly. Cris clearly working on Vivi - can see them sidelining Pam, you better get behind her. Raissa with the genius ideas as always (capturing emails for the mailing list from our Youtube viewers?!?!). Decided to scale down in the schools. One lesson per school per week. And relax the black belt requirement for kids to have lessons at the Aterro. Let’s get the thing moving. Dan and Wesley in both oficinas and giving lessons at Pereira Passos and GEO. Sort the tuba and percussion shortfall. Get this shit running without you.

Agreed R$25k for the roof job. Just get it done.

Still working on this presentation for a FB pitch to PRIO that you will probably never make (but which is helping structure your pitch for use internally and in other situations). 

Yesterday moved all of the instruments and project stuff up to the assunção. Gradually getting the house ready.

Favela Brass Mums playing up again, giving Cris hell in the group, trying to organize a boycott for São Paulo and now I have Kelly from the associação dos moradores wanting to talk to me again. Cris talking about not wanting to work in this capacity any more: I don’t blame her.

These Mums are a nightmare, but I do think that there is something in the way Cris deals with them that isn’t helping. She’s slippery and also at the start was on a mission to build herself up and put you down. It’s a lot of gossip and politics and I’m thinking maybe better to have someone a bit more straight.

Didn’t hear from PetroRio today. Not ideal. Feeling overwhelmed. Just too many things to remember.

Baile Brass with Os Siderais went well but you felt like crap, largely because you had to deal with Samuel’s Mum kicking off and Samuel going to get his trumpet and threatening that his dad will sue you.  Also found out on later that Lucia told all the other kids her stories about Rafael despite everything.

Cris wants to take the kids to Novo Friburgo which would be great in one way but I’m not sure I can face it at this point. Another sticky executive decision. Lucia shouldn’t have been at the party - that was you going with Cris’s decisions.

You will never be able to get away from Favela Brass politics. Cris will always be able to point at you as the one who decides which kid is in which group etc. But you can get the workload down and take some of the heat off you.

And in the long run, passing on the ED baton puts you on the off-ramp. Gives you more time to focus on getting the musical side less and less dependent on you. If you want to get out, this is the best way without the quality of the teaching suffering.

And here’s the kicker - you’re worried about abandoning the project when there’s a real possibility that it will actually do better without you. Let it fly and take the form that it will.

You will have done 3 years as ED, maybe a realistic goal would be 3 more in a gradually diminishing artistic director role then out.

2020

Fairly solid day. In the morning working on arrangement of Tim Maia’s “Eu não quero dinheiro”. Such a great artist - definitely the first place to look for MPB repertoire. Decided to do it for 3 trumpets and 3 troms. With a pro band you want to keep the numbers down but with the kids surely you want to include as many as possible - especially if it will make it sound better. This also opens up the possibility of Nelsinho-style samba and brass arrangements, with the option of using the sax like the voice, as as “puxador”.

Struggled through with only a green tea for breakfast (made from the leaves for you by the lovely chef at the the Litoral Hotel). Coming off caffeine really does hit you where it hurts. But productive day, got the newsletters off, tied up loose ends, gave lessons to the Marias and João Vitor. PF site not working it would be unfair if they fine you I think.

Just coming to the end of the holidays now. UK-style Christmas lunch was lovely and it has given you a taste of how you want life to be during term-time - i.e. working hard on the fun stuff like these British Council FB-DYJA exchange applications, arrangements, curriculum etc. Would have been nice to have a total rest from work though. One day!

Mark Sabin is very keen to set up a Favela Brass style brass band in Donny and it looks like we’re on for you setting up a band in the summer (just booked flights back for the UK school summer holidays). Coming back to this Street Brass United idea - with the DYJA, Bad Kissingen, Limonest, Herten, San Francisco, other UK bands.

2022

Teresopolis. It’s raining loads and the clouds are obscuring the views. First restaurant that fishy place where the mad waiter insisted on us trying chopp de vinho and didn’t bring the chips.

Nice hot chocolate place, antique shop and Teresopolis brewery was great. Monique bit drunk and random, back home and played cards.

Mum’s 70th this year, what are you going to do now that you didn’t take her to Manaus this time? At the hotel in Rio you asked what the best hotel breakfast Mum had ever had was and she said the one in Berlin for Dad’s 80th. That is, the one that you didn’t go to because you were too “busy” in Rio and/or were too proud to ask for the plane ticket.

Minor hitch at Charles de Gaulle airport yesterday - Brazil removed the exemption for Brits with permanent residency after the initial announcement on the 23rd of December. This info was only on the English-language side of the Itamatary website but that’s no excuse really - you should have double-checked everything. Only found this out at 23:30 when they didn’t let me get on the flight.

Subsequently ended up sleeping in CDG airport then getting a flight back to Heathrow and currently on a train up to Donny from Kings Cross. This particular debacle has cost you:

1 train ticket to Manchester and two up to Donny from Kings Cross plus tube fare and other bits (say £150).

COVID green-light at home - get back in the garage mate!

£120 of M+Ds money for another PCR test to cut quarantine if you go for it

£120 of your money for another PCR test to get back (assuming you need it when they open up again)

Time

Was very annoyed with myself and generally a bit miserable but a WHSmith meal deal, Costas Cappuchino and a chance to ride in a fairly empty carriage in one of the new Azuma trains has put a better complexion on things. 

To make sense of this you now need to spend the next few weeks working your arse off on the arrangements in the garage. Technically you could spend 14 days in another country and then go to Brazil but seems a little quixotic and expensive. If you were going to go down that route sooner rather than later would make sense.

Does seem like a good excuse to lock yourself in the garage and do arrangements though…

I’m grateful for Bach - that beginner Bach book has been a godsend. Perfect for getting you into improvising baroque melodies and harmonies. The next level of harmonic understanding is all there: just keep hitting the Bach - it’s like a harmony Arban.

I’m grateful for the new bike route going up to the caixa d’água then down via paineras (VERY grateful for that) and also grateful to whoever had the great idea of putting outdoor gym things all over Rio (including on my bike route)

On a more sombre note Dad isn’t well. Mum has sent cash to all his children (likely to be so I can get back in an emergency) and started a WhatsApp group to cover his health. She said he won’t be going abroad any more. Sounds like she’s managing expectations. It’s coming.

Today was the day that I started being able to improvise baroque melodies on trumpet. Something has clicked. It’s wonderful to be making such strides musically on the wrong side of 40.

Had a bit of an anti-Brazil funk today. Maybe I was just down. It just hit me what a selfish, careless, reckless bunch people here are when it comes down to it. And how it has been a bit of a one-handed clap with a lot of parents and kids.

Pensive at the moment. Can’t help feeling I let Dad down. No kids, no money, living in a slum in a house they paid for. You brought home a beautiful black girl that he would have loved to have as a daughter. Then dumped her.

He did his bit. He didn’t go around beating his chest doing philanthropic projects with other people’s money because that’s what he thought would make himself happy. His morality was to not drop the ball, to be able to provide for your family. To get on with the stuff of life. The holiday in Italy with the family. Playing duets father and son at the piano.

Spoke to Ed today and he called you on your U-turn about exams (you now have no interest in doing exams for Brazil having previously expounded passionately about it). Flip-flop. 

I’m grateful for having a Dad who could provide for me financially. So many people don’t and I just took it for granted. The music lessons, the instruments, the last 12 years in Brazil. You had it on a plate.

I’m grateful for bolo de aipim and I’m grateful for maple syrup. And for the combination of the two.

It’s all about the patterns. Not short patterns necessarily, better in fact to learn whole tunes. But it’s all about getting those patterns into your head. Those are the fuel. Those are the chess moves. How many cards can you do in a day? Let’s get to 52 a week mate. This is so important- it’s you the musician. Are you going to get to the real top levels or not?

Also I am getting more and more convinced about transposing stuff at the keyboard being the best way to understand it. Chord scale theory or schenkian analysis still can’t capture the whole thing, the ambiguous key centres. If you can hear something, go to the piano and play it in any key, you’ve understood it end of argument. 

Coming back down to earth, literally, I came off the bike yesterday. Wet tram rails - the classic. In a weird way you liked it. Be honest. Taking a proper knock for the first time in a few years - maybe since breaking foot (which was not fun at all).

It’s a fantastic imaginative, productive time. But there’s a creeping loneliness - missing having a girlfriend, sharing life, a lot. 

I am grateful for Tinder. Did I say that already? It got you past your sticking point (approaching girls) there’s no doubt about that. Only today I thought of all amazing the girls I have been with. What a privilege.

I am also grateful for whiteboards to change gears with thinking, and for Hedi’s pizza which I am taking a rain check on for the moment because of COVID.

Mum and Dad just gave you a bunch of cash clearly for you to come back. It’s possible via Mexico but I want to hold the fort with the lessons till the end of June. 

Thinking about writing a brass group arrangement that you could record. It’s a start for the budding composer in you.

Stressful time with all this business about foca and Rouanet. Went to Hedi’s for beer and pizza yesterday and it completely ruined me for today - woke up at 2am and couldn’t get back. Don’t do this any more.

Decent days’ work yesterday - now have trumpet, trombone and saxophone Vuo programs ready to go, sent the newsletter out in Portuguese and the English version is also ready. Added lots of people to the mailing lists (which should have been there for a long time).

Photos on Facebook with Carola and Stugger suggest that they’re still together. The fact that she will be bonding with the NYBB makes all of this more difficult politically. Both her and Stugger can be pretty pushy/brazen so this may not be easy. All you can do is be as nice about it as possible whilst sticking to your guns.

Woke up at midnight yesterday and couldn’t get back to sleep for a couple of hours - used the time to listen to the Language of Leadership book which was quite thought-provoking (maybe that’s part of why you didn’t get back to sleep!)

Good day’s work again. Only did one vid, but made the recorder and Figurenotes keyboard Vuo patches (this is the way to go). Started sorting out the footage from the doorstep recordings which looks great - thinking about just doing these vids myself as Amelia still hasn’t sorted website and it actually might be quite fun. Used Vuo with the webcam for the first time with João Vitor today and it worked an absolute treat - a lot of potential for using these tools in other settings, like in a classroom with projector as well.

What doesn’t feel good is the Favela Brass political situation. I feel like someone who is running out of friends. Technically, I’m at the centre of pretty much everything and hence very difficult to outright knock out, but if you end up with too many people against you internally things could get very uncomfortable. Falling out with Joe was far from ideal and puts you in a bad light for Raissa, Amelia and maybe Sigrun. No doubt Carola is will have some choice quotes from Mangueirinha and there are others sprinkled around like Andrew Snyder, Tim Malik. This may seem paranoid, but I worry that Carola and Stugger will be trying to get at my reputation, which of course, is everything.

How to respond? Don’t get angry, that’s for sure. If you come under attack, try not give them a target to aim at. Be nice, work hard and let the results do the speaking. If people are making you out to be a bad person who’s not up to the job, you have to embody the opposite so much that attempts to give you a bad name will backfire. But still, this is a tense time - my next move, firing Carola, is pretty obvious which gives plenty of time for a counter-strategy to be formed. This will be a test.

Lovely barbecue with the folks. Prawns and steak and you managed to do a decent job of cooking it. Rattled of some trombone vids in the morning and starting watching unity tutorials first thing. Tea, 90 minutes on, 30 mins rest etc.

Watched The Nightingale, a very dark film about English cruelty. Didn’t help with the current feeling. Have a very bad feeling about what Carola could be spreading around. Just try and get through all this, nothing more. Bloody but unbowed.barbecue with the folksand steamanaged to do a dcooking it.

Sunday - opted to work which was a good decision. 90 mins learning Unity, 90 mins knocking trombone videos out then had the idea of using wix to make a website for our course a bit like learn.unity.com - kept on that on and off till 9pm and it’s looking good.

3 cups of tea and a beer is working great for now - the beer is nice for the second, creative, evening peak. I am enjoying being back a lot. So much to do but it’s all such good stuff - pipeline, and not bucket stuff. Also loving the olds ambassador that I brought over - so much easier than the Kanstul. Practicing without practice mute is so much better as well.

As can be seen from the last 2 entries I think the beer is better saved till the evening in terms of mood!

Decent day. Productive morning cramming lots in before 11am, including learning about 2D physics stuff in Unity, putting a bunch of trombone and trumpet videos together and working on the student site. Made contact with the teachers which was nice and feeling better about stuff. Took a decent swing at the admin.

Carola said that she’s extending her stay in Donny. Didn’t say by how much, but when pressed said November. She disappeared for ages then came back without any kind of an apology or anything. Time to do it. Stugger will beat his chest, but I can’t see a way around here. She could end up staying anyway to be with Stugger - it’s obviously going ok. But November is a long time to find that out.

Just thinking about all this gets my blood pressure up.

Better day today. Woke up in the night and ended up sleeping in till 7:30, but then just spent the whole day on Unity. This “tunnel vision” approach is worth experimenting - less chopping and changing, just work on getting something done all day. Got to the point where I can shoot notes across a stave, and after having the whole day on that I’m ready for something different tomorrow. Will go with the site - might be good to turn the phone off tomorrow.

Nice chat with Mariana and talked to Mum and Talita about Carola situation. Feeling much better now that I’ve been in chatting with everyone from the project. This is the way. Much nicer to keep the communications open. Also chatted to Angelo this evening and hopefully the board should get moving again now.

Got a call from Carola before we went for coffee yesterday - said she wanted to talk to me as a friend and didn’t want me to let on to Stugger. Things hadn’t worked out between them and even though she cancelled her flight back, she didn’t want to be dependent on him. Wanted to know what options there might be for her to earn a bit of money in the UK in the next couple of months. Couldn’t really suggest much to her because informal working is much more difficult in the UK.

Went for coffee and Stugger was putting a brave face on it. Carola was getting up and going away quite bit - like she didn’t even want to be sitting down interacting with Stu. Was definitely a conversation with a lot of unspoken things in the background, but we got through it. Then in the evening she send a message saying that she’s going to go back on Sunday, but will spend a few days in London first. Didn’t try to find her a place to stay with friends, but did get Melissa to advance her another Favela Brass pay check.

All that time catastrophizing and none of it happened. You have to decide how to handle things with Carola now, but so many things that you worried about aren’t going to be an issue.

Out for beers at the Sal yesterday with Stugger. Drank halves to his pints which worked absolutely fine. Bad news on the Carola front - it was Stugger that gave her her marching orders, and she’s the one who’s upset. So now it makes it doubly difficult to fire her. Didn’t get into the nitty gritty of Carola at Favela Brass, just told him that she’s not been the easiest of people to work with.

Worse, is that what Stugger is saying makes it even clearer that she has to go - he has had the same experience of just arguing the whole time. She has said something to him about Paraty, and possibly tried to make out I’m crazy - he asked if I’d ever had mental health issues. I guess the thing is that now he can’t really fault me for firing her for exactly the same reasons that he finished her.

Got up for a piss in the middle of the night and Mum had a stress, saying “aren’t you even going to wash your hands?”. Didn’t get much sleep after that. It’s tricky the whole coming out of Covid thing - maybe should be playing it even safer especially living with Dad. Can’t forget that even in the UK it’s still out there.

Tasty time. Rouanet project must be sent in the next 2 days and the directors are freaking out about budget technicalities. Meanwhile trying to sort this German visit out. Actually think it’s going to turn out well - abcd, portas abertas, Zola etc. but difficult conversations coming with the diretoria about the costs.

Talking about Zola she will sleep outside for the second time tonight. Getting bigger by the hour! You’re definitely smitten. Now have 5 of the 7 commands working in training - just need to get them conditioned and add the last 2 (heel and off).

Nice visit from Wendy and Rob yesterday, went to Whitby’s then Kir royale with Valerie’s champagne and playing Victorian pinball (forgot the name).

Routine-wise been thinking that 3 hours on the main thing in the morning might be better than trying more than that. 3 hours on the wildly important goal, then let the whirlwind in. Practicing trumpet and piano straight after the 3 hours seemed to work nicely. Taking Bach (Easy Bach book) and Louis Armstrong (125 breaks and 44 solos) for half and hour each day will have a pretty profound impact. Just ordered the Well-tempered Clavier - imagine if you managed to have all of them memorised in all keys one day?

Booze and caffeine are catching up with you a bit now. Feeling a bit slow this morning.

Writing the diary with a beer. This is a novelty.

Oli’s family over the last few days, lovely BBQ yesterday and fun times watching old batman series episodes on Youtube. Just about managed to maintain the 3 hours in the morning on making course materials - recorder karate is well and truly done and now sorting out the melodica course which is already shaping up well.

These last few weeks have been great generally, but the whole Stugger Carola situation has been tricky. This afternoon you’ve had that horrible indecision feeling - tying yourself in knots thinking about the curry that you’re trying to organize for Wednesday as well as getting instruments fixed, how you’re going to do the trip to London and so on.

Just now you were feeling like you HAD to have a drink because you were feeling stressed about all this, but also because that is now the rhythm - after 3 cups of tea life you’re ready for a beer to make yourself feel human again at the end of the afternoon.

Point is, putting off decisions is not good. You end up making bad non-decisions by default and you end up with things dragging on. You have to get yourself out of this habit of turning from decisions. But, in your defence, tricky situation with Stugger and Carola and also Covid. This one with Carola needs thinking over really well now as it now turns out that she has come back from London.

I’m getting bored of this, so I’ll just list the options for now:

1. Fire her after curry. Set up a coffee and then just do it.
2. Fire her before curry.
3. Give her a dressing down now, take her off Rouanet and then wait till there’s a good opportunity.
4. Find stuff for her to do and bide your time.
5. Drop her to half wages
6. Say that you’ll only hire her when you need her.

Considerations

1. Would be good to talk to the board. This really is a good reason to delay - they are what give you legitimacy and the one way to not have them on your side is to do stuff like this without talking to them (but… they might try to block you)
2. Not having been able to talk to the board gives you an excuse to have delayed, as does the fact that her and Stugger are at a very delicate point.
3. You haven’t given her a clear warning, so might seem unfair
4. She is clearly a freelance and doesn’t even have Favela Brass down as her main job
5. Would be good to have her do the donkey work for Rouanet so it actually gets done!
6. You’re paying for the privilege of having your life made difficult.
7. She is taking the place of another person who you could be grooming to take over the development side of things.
8. You should not make big decisions based on what Stugger might say or do.
9. There’s a decent probability of Stugger and Carola falling out again
10. Carola and Stugger both play hard-ball with you. 
11. She’s telling people that you’re crazy and god knows what else, and generally working against you. Remember the 48 laws - you could really come to regret not seizing the moment here. Need to try to get her RIGHT OUT.

But here’s the biggest problem

=== August 3rd 2019.md ===
# August 3rd 2019
In your heart of hearts you know you did the right thing. But... this does leave you with a bit of a mountain to climb. You don’t want to be taking on other people’s children, and you yourself want to have kids. That means dating girls less than 30 years old, and it also means getting to the point where you can commit and start a family in the next few years.

I’ve realized that a part of this is learning to love people’s imperfections. Taking people as they are. Letting things go. You didn’t like Talita’s moments of inflexibility/insensitivity/selfishness, but you yourself most certainly have your inflexible, insensitive, and selfish moments. You can’t be a hypocrite about all this.

I think the thing is that you can’t spend the whole time thinking of why the other person doesn’t measure up. Making your list of things that they said or did that give you grounds for moving on. The primary focus has to be on making the relationship work - can I live with this? You yourself have to be a good boyfriend.

Only now, reflecting, can you see/understand what was at the heart of Talita’s way of doing things: she wants to stick up for herself, and what she thinks is right. She feels the need to defend her rights. As a black, poor woman in a macho society, isn’t that more than understandable?

You need, of course, to find a woman with whom the day-to-day is going to be pleasant, and who is not going to fight you over doing her bit. By the same token you shouldn’t be insisting on a doormat: YOU should be bigger than that.

One thing that became clear as well is that this business of wanting to be free to play the field is rubbish: it’s a happiness trap. Happiness is 1 woman.

Went out Saturday and drank more than I should have with Tom Le Mesurier. Was good for very little yesterday. Have to stop doing this - just don’t have the time. Alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks would seem like a good way to put the brakes on things.

Talita asked me if I was sure on Saturday and I replied in the affirmative. One things that you said to Tom seemed to make sense: you wouldn’t do it if things were right. At nearly 40 years old it would seem pretty crazy to be letting a relationship roll on where you are full of doubts. You can never be sure with any decision, but you can feel confident. Marrying Talita was not a prospect that filled you with confidence.

You have already started chatting on Tinder. On the one hand you wan to give yourself time to get over the breakup, and this really has left you down in the dumps and it’s weird how this actually feels like losing a person - like a relative dying. However, on the other hand you have no time to waste.

You had the Favela Brass parents meeting at your house on Saturday morning and only 3 parents went. As a result you cancelled lessons this week and made an ultimatum: come to the meeting next week, arrange another time, or out you go. The problem is parents not taking the project seriously. No responding to Whatsapp messages, and putting other things in front of the project.

What complicates matters slightly is that in 2021 you are going to be starting another set of classes, hopefully at CIEP, which may mean stripping down the course in the favela. To a certain extent, the parents’ lack of support and involvement plays into your hands for doing this. The more you demand of them now, the worse it looks if you later have to strip things down, in order to concentrate on the schools. For now, though, it would seem to make sense to work on what we have, to try and put things right in the knowledge that we can afford to lose students now.

Had a “night off” yesterday because of this impasse with the Favela Brass parents, spent a fair bit of it watching lectures from “The Great Courses”. A really great use of time - definitely going to keep the subscription rolling. Neuroscience and Liszt at the moment.

Still having moments of doubt about Talita. The reality of how hard it is to find a woman that you want to be with is setting in. How many of those girls on Tinder could you actually see yourself with? You’re really going to have to up your game now. Maybe find another social activity, like Cury Clube, so it’s not just gigs and Tinder.

Today is British School in Botafogo. This really is work - 4 x 50-minute lessons back to back on an impossible task (learning trumpet in a year one day a week) with difficult children and in a teaching team that hates you. Let’s see how this meeting with Claudia after school goes.

# August 7th 2019
Lorena left the project yesterday. The first of the long-standing students to go. Her mum said it was because she was doing college entrance exams in November, but one has has to ask oneself the question: why is she sending you this message now, and not before the first meeting that you tried las Saturday?

Lorena definitely wasn’t practicing and there is a fair chance that her mum was pushing her to do the lessons. She was also missing quite a lot of the lessons. For the long-term when it’s like that, it’s better all round for the student to go. If all it takes is a little pressure on the mother to attend a meeting, then you know that the passion to play simply wasn’t there.

At this point there is some serious strategic thinking to be done to make sure that the next phase of Favela Brass is constructed on a solid foundation and wastes neither time nor money.

=== August 8th 2019.md ===
# August 8th 2019
Thinking more seriously about the idea of doing an online iPGCE. With that, your CV starts to look quite good for teaching jobs at international schools. The option of extending it to an MA is also tempting (have to find a way to finance it).

A full-time job at an international school would give you financial security, a good school to send your kids to and also a potential stream of students to join your extra-curricular programs. Indeed, what makes this seem like a viable option is the idea that Favela Brass is moving towards the idea of a 2:30pm - 5:30pm extracurricular band program at CIEP. No reason why private school students couldn’t be a (paying) part of that, or why you couldn’t do the same thing for TBS students on Tuesdays & Thursdays.

Yes, it would mean a lot of time giving lessons for rich kids and less “free” time for self-development. But remember that all teachers have free periods and all you would have to do is buy a laptop. The melodica lessons that currently happen at 12H and 14:30H could be covered by other teachers, so you would be looking at 7:30 - 15H in the schools, followed by 15:30-17:30 at CIEP, then maybe 18:30 - 20:30 in the favela. It’s a lot, but remember all the public holidays, lost days and the fact that it all stops for July and January.

David Brennan made a point about doing things while you have time. At the moment you don’t have kids or a wife - that may not always be the case. It does seem like a good time to do this. Sometimes you just have to move in the right general direction. Take Talita’s advice: get yourself qualified.

Finished recording of azul cor do mar. I would say a fairly solid arrangement and also easy to play. Didn’t do the video this time - save time by only doing videos for the big ones. The sound on these recordings is great. You’re going to end up with at few albums worth of your own arrangements released - just need to ring fence 90 mins of writing and 30 of recording.

Had the idea of shorter stints on the melódica in the schools. Do 5 sets of 5 week inductions during the year. Makes more sense to get round everyone. Find the ones that will study at home - they have to come to us.

The parts of the job that stress you, the politics, the sticky situations, the treacherous individuals - you must treat it as an enjoyable game. You must learn to thrive on all these problems that need solving. Wake up and say “I love this”. Take it all with a pinch of existentialist salt and keep your sense of humor. Laugh at them, laugh at you,

DAILY NUGGET

We can’t take anything with us. We can’t leave an immortal legacy. So what does that leave? Living a good, fulfilling life. Doing what feels good - working with other people to achieve worthwhile stuff.

2021

Last night in Lisbon. Gambar the prawn place - very good indeed. Running out of steam by the end of the night. Up very early this morning to fly back Ryanair which is a bit basic. 

Listening to 4,000 weeks still, and still trying to get my head round it. One of the most enjoyable moments of the holiday was obsessively practicing Bach on the battlements of Lisbon castle, contemplating the view.

You like creating, you like developing, you like making music. That feeling of things gradually getting better. Is that “instrumentalizing” your time? What’s the problem if you enjoy it? The whole work/leisure thing is more of a grey area for you.

Oliver Burkemann says that spending all our time working for tomorrow is silly, because we never reach the “promised land”. Well, that may be the case if you’re a lawyer, but as a musician honing his craft, or a teacher getting his band together things are a bit different. There’s a pleasurable rhythm of improvement - “is there somewhere you’d rather be?”

Fact is that we’re all going to go one day and we can’t take any of our achievements with us. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t savor them during our life. Many great things in the book, and yes hobbies and downtime are great, but to say that it doesn’t make much difference what we do with our lives is to downplay the human experience too much.

To make other people’s lives better is meaningful, and human joy and suffering are very real for those who experience them. It starts at home, but yes it is worth working hard to make things better for those around us, even if it won’t last a thousand years. What else do we have?

Shitty day yesterday. Gabriel from PRIO casually dropped in that they won’t be giving giving us money until next year, which totally throws a spanner in the works. Really puts the heat on you, because you didn’t arrange other companies.

Then in the staff meeting Cris says that she didn’t realize that the plan was to give private lessons in the school, despite that having been made crystal clear on October. Penny dropped that she just presented her vision to the SME. You then sent had a meandering back and forth os áudios with Wesley confirming that he is thinking on the same lines as Cris.

What to do now?

1. Do absolutely everything to have PRIO’s sponsorship money by the end of the year. Make sure Diane knows. Invite her to the baile and get to a conversation about next year.
2. Do absolutely everything to get more money in via rouanet: now the newsletter is out think about WhatsApp groups. Talk to the BCS bods.
3. Plan out what you would do if you didn’t get the cash and if you did. Make the plans practical and go to Cris with a clear list of the permissions we need from the SME. Go over plan with staff. Understand from Cris what authorisations we will have. 
4. Get yourself into this conversation with the SME so Cris can’t blindside you again. Then look at leaving the school contacts with Pat as produtora executiva.
5. Calm down. Don’t lash out at any part for all of this. Smile, and keep everyone on board as you do the above. Don’t harass. Don’t complain.

Good and bad. Called Sômulo on his bullshit and told him not to open up another channel of communication with PetroRio. The worse thing any board member can do is give the impression that they don’t have faith in me. This micromanaging bullshit has to stop. Problem is, Sômulo is a dangerous person to piss off.

New figurenotes transposing sheets worked ridiculously well today. I almost didn’t have to do anything: the kids just got at it and didn’t stop. This will get them practicing at home.

Katarina enjoyed lesson doing harmonies and transposing. Here is something that is more rigorous and more enjoyable - money!

I am very grateful to the new and old directors that are taking favela brass on. This is what will move the project forward, give it weight and potency. It is growing its own legs.

Baile Friday with Sesame Mucho was amazing. Logistics problems with handover to Vivi and Cris overspent on refrigerante, food and beer.

Been getting back into dating recently - Patrícia last week (didn’t speak very much) and Thamires last weekend and this weekend (great, but doesn’t want kids).

FB up in the air as Pamela is at her conference, Vivi busy tying up prestação de contas for a previous project. Got pissed off with Cris yesterday for the half-assed sign-up campaign in the schools. 

Yesterday the instituto Darcy Ribeiro didn’t sell at auction with starting price R$1,2m. Very very tempted to borrow money to get it. This morning realised that you could do events there as well which could make some decent cash. You’d have at least half a dozen rooms to rent out straight off the bat (Let’s say (R$4.000), then probably 12; you’d have a space where you could do a monthly/weekly jazz party (another R$4.000) and sell a bunch of booze. And you’d be able to rent rehearsal and office space to Favela Brass (another R$2.000 to start). R$10.000 straight out if you play your cards right. Plus rental on your house and your salary.

Just did the whole figurenotes transposing thing with Gabi for the first time. Within about 30 mins she was playing twinkle twinkle in C, F and G, but most importantly, conceptualizing the scale degrees. This is a breakthrough. After all these wacky dead ends, you have something that actually works.

Listening to “responsive teaching”. Interesting this distinction between formative and summarize assessment. If ABRSM are the yearly summative exam, where is the unit-by-unit formative plan?

I’m grateful for great movies, I’m grateful for being able to order cheap fish to the door.

I’m grateful for the amazing world out there to travel. All the incredible cities, foods, views, historic sites that stretch out to infinity.

2023

Ding dong with the finance committee last night about advancing money to the staff while we’re waiting for the adequação of Rouanet 2023 to go through. Lots of silly talk from the board about suspending the project, talking to the sponsors, us all getting done for corruption because we lent some money and took it back. Long and short: Mirela’s too small for the president job; you have a board that loves to whinge about a lack of cash but doesn’t do anything to help bring it in.

Saw the Darcy Ribeiro building today with Pam and her architect friend. Walked back with her to her house and talked about the executive director thing. Genie’s out of the bottle now. She’s a bit arrogant, doesn’t have much in the way of charisma, and snarls from time to time. But she’ll be a safe pair of hands for Favela Brass. There’s an aspect of you giving up, but you have to ask yourself: is artistic director and executive director viable as the team grows? Is that really best for the project?

Question is: what’s your niche now? If you’re only doing music at Favela Brass you’ll have a bit of time for a sideline or 2: wouldn’t running a band or two and writing arrangements for them be the ticket? I guess the main thing is getting at the Brassify thing. It’s a good idea. Do it right and it’s bigger than Favela Brass. The world needs it, and it could take you anywhere. Go get ‘em, founder. 

2022

Parents meeting for Paraty. Fallen off the caffeine wagon. Stressing about Rouanet project.

2021

Got up late at 6, then had a breakthrough - the whole thing of doing melodic and rhythmic variations on easy tunes for the technical exercises part of the exam. Now there are tunes at the heart of everything they will do. 

Thinking about what a site could be for me to sell my stuff online. Finished the day with tunefulstudies.com or tunefulpublications.com hmm

Regivaldo slowly sorting house stuff - just waiting for Eliezer to try and gauge my eyes out with the price of these asbestos roof panels. This is all getting a bit expensive.

I am grateful for the nights where I sleep well and wake up with a clear head. I am grateful in advance for the amazing food I’m going to eat in Mexico.

I’m grateful (for being able to go out like a light when I don’t have a cup of tea after lunch, rs)

Lovely lessons today teaching Edileuza, Duda and Katarina to play tunes in different keys with your new system. This is such a winner! Music grades where they actually learn to become musicians who who have thought it. Remember: you love teaching students with your materials.

On the down side worried about the whole asbestos side of things. Daren’t even look at google. Just get the place a “deep clean” and get on with it i guess. The good thing to come out of this roof falling in could be that you use it as an impetus to keep improving the house. 1 day each Regivaldo and Antônio per week would go a long way - One day per week could be house day etc..

Found Bach’s 2 part inventions today and printed out some chorales. The most productive practice thing seems to be studying/memorizing Bach. These are your chess moves.

I am grateful for being able to test teaching materials out on students and get immediate feedback. That freedom is very special. You’re in a great position to construct an innovative, yet practical course.

I’m grateful for being able to cook curry for myself. I’m grateful for not having to watch my calories during the day (bread rolls with eggs and too much butter in the morning... mmm)

Music practice at the moment is boiling down to studying Bach (and improvising in that style). That seems to have the most meat on it. Loving it. Just started the two part inventions. Not sure whether to tackle the chorales yet. 

Wet and windy weather is hampering building work but regivaldo is still getting stuff done. Let’s get up to Airbnb standard and make some money off this place. I still think it would make a nice change of gear to have one full day on the house listening to music nothing else.

Cristiane accepted today so it’s her, Norton, Bindu and Lucca coming in this time. Exciting stuff! After paying back my debt in pounds today (over R$11k) I could do with a board that helps bring in the cash and sees the need to pay me properly.

I am grateful for the outside shower, for the natural spring water on the road up past CEAT and being able to more or less keep my own sleep hours. Imagine not being able to get enough sleep, having sleep disrupted - walking around sleep deprived. You’re on a great schedule

Can’t believe it’s less than a year since Pam went. At least you did it and got rid of her.

In a mad rush to get the prestação de contas done today in time for the finance meeting, but it’s not work that you don’t like. It’s the politics and the overwhelm that you don’t like.

You are putting into practice some of the things from last year’s diary: just doing the first band and moving out of the favela. Handing things over slowly is a good idea: allows you to stop at any point in the process if you think you have found a sweet spot as well.

Just putting the finishing touches to Beyoncé Crazy in Love

2023

Baile Brass yesterday with the Bloco das Tubas. Really low audience turnout - was advertised at the last minute because of delay in confirming the band and approving the flyer. Everyone needs to have a think about how we can get a better turn out at the next one (which involves everyone inviting a few people there, including board). Students played great though and had a good time.

Despite wanting to pass over the reigns to Pam, there is a niggling worry: she can be an arrogant, bossy cow at times and she isn’t treating you with proper respect (same for Viviane). She has already rolled her eyes at you (signalling contempt) in meetings and talks over you. The question is: will this move make things worse or better for you? Are you rushing to get out of a bad, fixable situation but creating a worse, unfixable (or fixable only by you leaving) situation? Or will this dynamic always be there with whoever you get in?

Where do you want to go with this? Last night after the ball Joe and annoying Ukranian Airbnb guest Viktoria were out. You cranked up the hi-fi, nailed some beers, and jammed along on the trumpet: ecstasy. You take pleasure and satisfaction from music. Not from endless team meetings. In your heart, you just want to be creative - to write and record arrangements, and to play great music in public. 

In terms of Favela Brass if you could just teach the top band (including impro), and define the course materials and repertoire that would be grand. There’s some politics in there but nothing you can’t handle. Remember that top band will just get better with time. Other teachers would LOVE to take ownership of a specific bands, and Joe is better than you gave him credit for. One day of teaching in the schools could actually be quite pleasant as well.

This opens the door for you to live outside the favela if want to, maintaining good relations here. And if you ever did want to move somewhere else, you could be employed by Favela Brass to look after their course. Wouldn’t the board love to have you as a prestador de serviços? What about the consultancy thing?

This comes back a bit to the Shimano gears thing - would it be you looking after Favela Brass’s course, or would you be looking after Brassify, which Favela Brass would be using? Would the Shimano gears be the Favela Brass course in other projects, or Brassify in a bunch of projects including Favela Brass?

And coming back to it - it was so nice to be blowing away freely on the trumpet. Not the petty politics. Remember that dream of the white room? That room could be where you live now, or it could be somewhere else. You could invest in a house for Airbnb or… you could just invest the cash and use the interest and rent on your house to get by while you focus on Brassify. The truth is that you have the room you need at least for audio recordings 

2022

Turma 2 at the alternative book fair in Praca Odilo Costa. Very annoyed in morning with Cris essentially authorizing Laura not to do the show. Ended up doing the show on bass drum with a very small band but went alright. Did the churrasco of Me Enterra na Quarta later which was a great success.

« Remember that to improve, one must master difficulties each day »
- Herbert Clarke

Started reading the Strive book, which is a good complement to the Becoming Who you Are. Basically, there’s no such thing as a free lunch: you’ll have a better life dealing with unpleasant stuff and putting up with risk.

With Favela Brass it’s a case of working out what the most courageous thing would be: to stick with it, or to go for it with the arrangements. At least the 90 mins per day 6 days a week NO MATTER WHAT is ingrained now, but what if you went at it all day every day for a year? Five years?

Thinking about what would get more people playing your arrangements and coming back to that idea about university students. They’re at the right age and in the states must be plenty of students who could handle the charts because of the whole band program culture. How to get a foot in the door while still living in Engenho do Mato… what can be done online?

In the podcast Adam Fraser talks about how people’s end of life regrets are about not having had the courage to go for it. « It » for you is creating these arrangements with videos. To create the brass band real book.

2022

Rehearsal at CIEP. Trying to work out who to put on what instrument. Zuri wants to do trombone. Great! Vinicio said about tuba but the logistics might be difficult. Maybe do Tpt/Sax/Trom with the pereira brothers.

Really wanted to chill later but had to do Cacilda for a grand total of 2 horns and 3 percussion students. Only me, Dan and the new sax guy (misreal?) later. At least it didn’t cost you more than a few Ubers.

2021

Think you may have found your active recovery activity: working on the house. It works really well to take you away from thinking about syllabuses etc., it combines well with audio books and it is very satisfying to be getting things done. Also great generally to have a nicer, tidier house and also obviously good from a hosting point of view. 

May have hit on the exam format (again) this morning. Just work with the public domain tunes. Stick all the exercises (transposition, variations, etc.) in pdf, support them with references and YouTube playalongs, including whole-exam playalongs. Thing is, this makes it more of a method. Ed won’t like it. The free choice pieces are what make it an exam. But how to support them with accompaniment? Also the trumpet exam pieces on the UK lists seem distinctly uninspiring. The literature just isn’t there.

Tom Le Mesurier got in touch saying he’s had a call ostensibly from the gang that run coroa (TCP?), obviously I couldn’t help directly. Been thinking quite a bit recently about the “situation” here in Pereira: ninguém aceita apanhar.

Taking stock a bit. Had a caffeinated week last week that wasn’t particularly fun all told - lot of conflict, things starting to fray a bit with Cris and Camila. But really it’s just the sheer workload and the stress of Rouanet and Paraty.

Wanting to take some down time but even just the morning off today will land me in trouble. Really missing having a girlfriend. Weekends.

Mate. Stop drinking caffeine. Maybe even more alcohol. Max out the exercise. Meditate at least a bit. Tidy. Fruit. Do the whole active recovery thing.

There’s a bit in 4.000 weeks about spending your life doing things that you enjoy. You enjoy giving lessons, writing arrangements, playing music. Communications, admin, sponsors, politics, board meetings less so. Spread this work out!

Just finished watching the “One Day” series which for some reason messed with you. Emma Morley reminding you strongly of Seetal Patel.

Coming to the end of a week of making French food for Thamires (Mother’s day present). That’s actually the most meaningful thing you’ve done this year. It would be great to keep on with this - there’s nothing better than knocking her socks off with some fancy French recipe and there’s nothing worse than getting to the day with nothing in the fridge debating whether to get another burger or not. Your hobby should be cooking up a storm. Have been asking Claude for fusion recipes of Indian and French food with Brazilian ingredients with some interesting looking results. Thinking that there’s still a lot of mileage in French food.

2023

Looking at last year: the warning signs for Cris were right there - admin nowhere and isolating you from key contacts. You can’t deny that there are warning signs for Pam now.

Reading « Attention Span » by Gloria Mark and have realised that it’s about maintaining mental resources through the day, including resting. Have come back to the Pomodoro method, which was transformative yesterday. Much more work, much less stress! Now have confidence to resume piano in the morning. Remember this one.

First lesson at Alberto Barth. Lovely kids, Great lesson. Using proper black and white recorder karate book which is a big improvement. Laser printer overloads system at home and now power is out. Registrations not going well - overly complicated registration form with errors.

Playing Tchaikovsky choral with turma 1 show just how weak their sight reading is. Make them read. Paraty show looking good but need to think through solos and your spiel. A bit miffed that Cris hasn’t introduced me to Roberto.

Total overload at the moment with various things behind schedule (irpf, Rouanet, registrations).

I’m grateful for being able to improvise on the trumpet.

Pam very stroppy in meeting yesterday about 10 years celebrations with Vivi, when I suggest that the Cristo action could be our main event that happens whatever. The question is: is she the kind of person that is going to lead Favela Brass to victory, or make everyone’s life (including the board and partners) a misery. Feels like you have given away your power and to take it back is difficult. But you still haven’t given away your DE position. Bindu suggests staying as DE and delegating the musical director part: will mull that over…

Bit stressed. You have let it go a bit in terms of falling back into drinking coffee every day and not meditating. You’re not even particularly burning in the mornings now. Cycle to Ipanema and get yourself some tea tomorrow. First thing is to get off the coffee.

After helping joe and Amelia with their recording at Raissa’s had an awkward moment asking Amelia if she could give Helayne a bit of space tomorrow. It’s definitely not the best thing for house relations to be the COVID nazi, but at the end of the day if it stops her working out in the house while the cleaner is in that is more important.

Looks like Dad has heart failure and Mum not sounding too optimistic. Wikipedia says heart failure sufferers have a 35% chance of death in the first year and 10% each year thereafter. Death rates similar to some cancer diagnoses. Poor old Dad, can’t imagine what must be going through his mind now.

I’m grateful for my own health, and for the 40-50 years I hopefully still have to live. So many incredible experiences, friendships and achievements to be had. So many possibilities.

Well... bit of a wild week so far. Antonio and his sons arrived like some kind of building whirlwind and sorted out downstairs roof and upstairs housing in 2 days with time to  spare. Impressive stuff!

Meanwhile I came down with a fever, headache and godawful diarrhea on Monday night and didn’t know what day it was till Wednesday evening. Did the COVID test, very glad that was negative. Round about lunchtime today pulled myself back together and actually got quite a bit done including lessons with Katarina and Maria Rita.

Really awkward situation - Dani and Carlos are getting married and I basically agreed to play with Maria Rita but it’s finally plucked up the courage to wimp out. Why? Because it’s going to be a freaking packed igreja universal ceremony. Would love to do it under any circumstances but not with COVID as it is - made out to them that I was worried about testing positive for flying but I really just don’t want to sacrifice my principles and partake in an agglomeration.

A lot of listening to Robert Greenberg’s lectures and also ruminating about the situation with the old neighbors.

Great to be able to get back to piano practice (which is pretty much Bach practice at the mo). The motto is: “if in doubt... pull a card”. “Fucked it up? Pull a card” etc..

Ed Matkin approached positiva about the grades and put it in his report. Not a good sign at all. Good that he did that now. You see him and can react accordingly.

I am thankful for my returning health. I am thankful for Antonio’s building whirlwind ways and for having a roof on downstairs.

I’m super grateful for living in nature - to have that combination of bustling city life (temporarily suspended for me anyway) and trees and hills and wildlife all around is very special.

First cortejo at the Aterro Saturday and Atados DBA with OV at Arpoador Sunday. 

Trying to get Rouanet project approved but Mirela being difficult - starting to think that we need a new president for next year.

Getting more organized and this seems to be helping quite a bit with stress - I just focus on executing the system, rather than getting overwhelmed thinking about all the things that I should be doing. The whole EDP/ADP/EDI/ADI pomodoro cycle thing seems to be a winner when you can get it going.

Thinking a lot about this idea of doing a sabbatical next year. Is it practical? Will the board revolt (Especially Mirela)? Is the team ready (we’re getting to the point where it’s time to resolve the Cris issue)?

The thinking is that only by you leaving will people actually learn to run the day-to-day without you. Then you are able to come back in in a role that you will be able to do forever because it’s not going to burn you out or drive staff nuts. Writing arrangements, rehearsing the main band, organising the curriculum.

Can it run without you? The secret sauce is the arrangements and the syllabus. And those will only get better with you away from the day to day.

Another way is for next year you to get away just from the day to day - to go straight to the role that you wanted to go to after the year out. Maybe you could still move away, but come back for the weekends for Friday’s rehearsal, the Aterro and the shows if needed (Fri/Sat). Where to sleep Friday night?

Coming back to this… the big question is whether you can trust Pam with the project. She’s just not that nice. It’s a gamble - she’s efficient and strict with staff, but she’s got you looking at the door. To be fair you were already looking at the door. She’s now working on cutting Cris out of the project, stripping her of her duties at the aterro, getting an admin assistant in to learn her job. Feels a bit like you set a rottweiler on Cris - and yourself. Do you want a rottweiler running Favela Brass?

She’s arrogant and demeaning, with a hint of contempt. Can you leave someone like that at the wheel? 

2022

Paraty was a great success. Kids absolutely nailed it and you really enjoyed it - maybe this is the way you travel in Brazil. Slightly worried that the festival might be a bit threatened by the way the kids outshined the rest of it, but it’s hard to imagine us not getting a bunch of great stuff off the back of this.

Now for the bad bit. You were caffeinated and gave out some pretty heavy-handed and unfair bollockings. First the sax player Dudu for leading you the wrong way with the bloco, then with Alexandre at the end of the bloco for trying to keep the kids playing. Then finally Camila twice on the last day for the kids putting stickers on their instruments and getting involved production decisions with Robert.

To be fair, the situation with Robert was annoying, but you didn’t exactly handle it with aplomb - quite the opposite. Too much caffeine and not enough sleep. Shades of TBS. Carry on like this and you’re going to lose all your friends. There will always be a bunch of stuff to do. Cut the caffeine out now.

Turma 1 students are really excited to play now. Great energy in the lesson today. Thinking about doing a bloco/orquestra/banda division mon/wed/fri. Need to think all this through tomorrow…

Back to the red card?

To say you drank a cair bit of gabriela yesterday today was actually a pretty strong day. Woke up in middle of night and ended up sleeping in till 07:30 but after that went pretty much straight till now and got a fair bit done.

Practicing 6 mins as soon as possible in the hour every hour with annoying reminder on computer worked today. You did at least 30 mins each trumpet and piano. Think of saving 10% of your waking 12 hours for practice giving 36 mins each piano and trumpet. Pay yourself first. Oh, and tidying up seems to combine better with the evening wind-down than practice.

Had the idea of recording Maria Rita playing the tune for her parents’ wedding so they could either just play it in the church or she could play along but her mum said not to worry about it. More relaxed now.

Spoke to Andre and since he wants to go for it with the military band I suggested the tuba. He liked the idea.

Very strong ideas this morning in terms of method: set band keys fir each piece plus graded difficulty level in each key. Keep making it cleaner.

I’m grateful for my ear protectors. I’m grateful for sleeping in the fresh air.

I’m grateful for having got involved in education and being able to make my mistakes over the last 8 years. You’re a good teacher - don’t let the British school experience make you think otherwise. All those mistakes are adding up to one practical method.

Oh fuck. Vivi said she wants to leave today. From what I got second hand from Pam she’s found out that one of the nodes that she was going to have removed in a thyroid operation is a high risk of being malignant. But I’m not sure it’s just that. I think we have to be open to the possibility that she couldn’t face another meeting with Pam - that Pam *destroyed *her.

The question: is it just me?

You need to get your strategy straight: you already showed your hand far too much to Pam and now she views you as a busted flush, an inconvenience. But then Cris is difficult too: lots of politics and gossip, and can’t trust her with the work. Vivi was a nice person who got down to work, but she was between a rock and a hard place with Pam and Cris. And you didn’t nail the structure down properly so there’s all this politics.

Cris must be looking at the door as well. Pam is calling her out in meetings, getting her contacts off her and trying to make the aterro work without her. She’s a rottweiler.

So what now? Firing Pam is more difficult with Vivi not around. But you have a problem that won’t get easier: she’s making life at Favela Brass a misery. If you want to get out and then get back in again, you need someone competent, yes, but also someone who is good to work with. What you can’t have is a bunch of toxic staff who chew new recruits up and spit them out.

Think it through. 2024:

Diretor: New Produtora
Diretor Artistico: You
Produtora Executiva: New Hire
Assistente de Produção: Bolinho
Diretora de Produção: Raissa

Pam bumps Cris off, then you bump Pam off or put the produtora in above her.

Joined the club. Tested positive for COVID today. Was feeling like crap last night, tested this morning, looked negative then later on turned out positive. Got the symptoms. At least I opted to ask Joe to do the lessons in the schools today.

Listening to The Laws of Human Nature. Howard Hughes and all that. Are you a hyper perfectionist that is a nightmare to work with? Should you carve out a career as the visionary behind Favela Brass and not try to handle the day to day?

Raissa has stirred things with Cris and Camila and probably blabbed a mixture of true things and gossip. She was rude to you in the meeting and Cris is also being short with you. You now have 3 female employees that want to push you out. This going to be sticky. Stiff upper lip and all that.

2021

More honing of tune-based curriculum in the morning - it’s coming on. Number of unique notes a great rough proxy for tune difficulty. This is going to be a really good system for Rio.

Started listening to the Mozart Greenberg lectures whilst cycling. 

Allowed myself to get irritated with Mirela sending out invite to annual meeting tomorrow at 19h at 20h tonight. Back to the same shit. No bios of the new members either. Wasn’t that blatantly obvious? 

Hold up, the bios was a miscommunication on your part. Always read the ata. They thought it would be on the site. And just chill out a bit. Stop
getting pissy with people - it’s what is messing everything up. Firm but friendly has to be the motto. Professionalism. Reasons to cut out caffeine and meditate more. Speaking of which...

I am grateful for my board president Mirela and the time she is dedicating to the project for free. I am grateful for the useful things I learned on the operational research course at umist. 

I am grateful for having the early mornings as “non-time” for working on lofty things like music curriculums.  It’s a privilege - you could be in a job where that time is squeezed out. [greetings from 2023]

Came to the conclusion yesterday morning that Pam has to go because she’s not up to the Ed role - mainly because she’s a massive cow. Who is going to want to deal with her? “Eu não tenho incremento” and the whole business of wanting to inform PRIO that we won’t do any more shows with less than 2 weeks notice.

After an almost sleepless night spoke to Melissa, Sômulo, Mirela and Lucca with a view to firing her, but only Melissa has the stomach for it.  And we come back to the situation than they won’t accept Favela Brass without me reporting to the board.

You need to calm down and work out the strategy here: you want to get favela brass to the point where it’s running without you, but you’re still organizing the course and the arrangements. 

Chatted with Lucca about how to get you out of the day to day - and all these meetings. The Rouanet dúvidas meetings, meetings about the logistics of the festa junina, activities planning for the month. The idea of all this was to have someone to handle just the Rouanet project. 

You need to be USING Pam. She’s a great cat’s paw and she can handle the day to day.0

If you’re going to stay above Pam you need to avoid being in meetings as musical director. Do you put someone else in for this? Do you need someone else to be in charge of rehearsing the band and doing shows full time?

You need to get to a point where it’s the others who are running ragged and not you. 

The other thing that crossed your mind is handing your notice in. But what is difficult with that is: who hires the next project coordinator? Isn’t that the board? Or is that your role?

It’s like you almost have to care less about the project.

Ok so here’s the key insight: the ideal is you creating great materials and giving the lessons. The next best is you creating great materials and other people giving the lessons. Yesterday you didn’t have the materials you needed for the lesson and that weighed more than you being there or not to give the lessons.

If you have a cool new arrangement with supporting videos and people to work on it with the students isn’t that enough? If you have a thorough curriculum with exams and method books isn’t that enough? Joe’s your go-to guy for this. Give him the setlist and off you go. And this goes for shows as well. Any teacher should be able to take a band to a show and pick a setlist.

2022

Reading last year’s entry and can’t help hearing the old man’s words: keep your feet on the ground. You nailed Paraty musically but you didn’t keep calm. If you’re going to lead this thing, even with a light touch, you’d better be the one calming other people down.

While we’re at it if you’re so thin skinned, then wouldn’t it make sense to be sensitive with other people’s feelings? It all just comes back at you with interest. Work on the hearts and minds of others.

Enjoyable day working on princesa arrangement, meetings etc. Brain definitely not working well though.

Lucia tested positive for COVID and looks like Cris and Hedi have COVID so cancelled the gigs off this weekend. Would have been a shitshow without you anyway.

2021

Creeping little victories with the method (thinking Favela Brass method is the brand and maybe your escape from being ED in a few years could possibly be spreading the method abroad). New way of presenting transposing version with computer notes on single live stave looks good, as does the coloured static harmony representation.

Finally finished the guri recordings. There aren’t as many of them as there could have been and they aren’t that good. But it’s done. There is a lot to be said for working through written arrangements but I prefer doing transposable tunes, harmonies backings plus rhythm reading warmups for each tune (another innovation today).

I am grateful for the opportunity to make so much of a difference in Rio. This could really be transformative for the city. It’s very exciting and never forget whatever the wrinkles you have the main thing that most people never have - a purpose.

I am grateful for my kindle to read books like the Lisbon history I just downloaded, and I am grateful for the art of manliness podcast and it’s nicely varied selection of topics and interviewees - perfect for cycling up a hill with!

If you want to be safe, stay in the community. Be loyal. You could go to Lisbon and then what? Lisbon Carnaval - yeah right! Aryelle, Edileuza, Marquinho, Rafa, Maria Rita, Davi - you going to leave them behind?

Remember that vídeo? You are doing something that requires courage. 

Are you a fantasist? Or can you plant you feet somewhere and make stuff happen? 

Quality of life indexes mean nothing. Look at Amelia - flitting away, wants to do ethnomusicology to visit all these other countries. But where’s the purpose? Means nothing.

It’s all about the meaning. 

Question has been asked though. If the ideal thing is handing the ED role of favela brass off, what would you afterwards? Don’t have to leave Brazil, don’t have to leave favela brass but what would you do? What would you want to do?

Should have told Margo about Bob sooner.  Like as soon as you joined the BCS. Dude. You can be shrewd and strategic and all that, but Bob desperately needed help and you delayed essentially for selfish reasons. You should, above all, be decent. Stop being a twat.

Thinking that the route might be:

1. Hire Coordenador (maybe Glaucya) to handle the grunt stuff. Then you have time to sort the DE stuff and really get the cash in (2022) - don’t go mad and over-expand. More cash = more quality.
2. When the right person appears and you have the cash, hire an ED (someone like Dan Lassen or Ed Matkin) and you become Musical Director - just rehearsing the bands, writing the arrangements and training the teachers in your method. This is where you have time to properly lay out the musical blueprint. (2024-2026)
3. Hire a new MD and train other project(s) to implement your method. Either as part of FB or as an independent consultant. (2028 - 48)

Fell off the wagon and drank tea for the first time in ages. Did 23 pomodoros and got a lot of stuff shifted.

Worried about this Rouanet/FOCA thing.

First ever trumpet Miyagi video from Lúcia.

2021

Meditating, writing the diary and receiving piano in the evening is the way (then reading till you fall asleep). Do keep meditating, it is something unto itself. Cut out news if you need more time.

Cycled to Leblon today to buy the most expensive tea ever. It already put you in a better mood. You want to be a light tea drinker, coffee in absolute emergencies or at airports. 

Talked to Mark Ellis about exams/method. Jim Stretton and his friend Ed Maxton also with some good input via email. It’s coming together, I just Ed Matkin has the patience to give me time to make something good, and the foresight to let me give the format a little twist.

Thought about when Talita said she woke up dreaming that she was in my arms. Must have been tough for her. Maybe still is. Hurts to think about it.

I’m grateful for having a warm blanket for sleeping. I’m grateful for having a local hi-fi repair guy who has managed to fix the marantz amp.

I’m also grateful for all my times with Talita. To have had a real relationship. That was your only one really. It’s was not always easy but just for a bit there your life was in stereo.

Bit of a slow Sunday. Just watched ma Rainey’s black bottom which was definitely not as good as the reviews made out. The wild thunderstorm outside was more entertaining (thankfully the roof is still on).

Trying to come up with a name for the method. Do you even need one? Is it really that big of a deal? Why not just favela brass method and make it free? Street smart brass wasn’t bad but not the one. Is the method really the thing?

Picked up double bass from Pedro Aune today. Who is going to play it (other than me)? Looking at logistics for going home and getting vaccinated. Sooner rather than later would be good. Maybe via Mexico and US. Have to stay till end of May to sort out this vid with Guri, and don’t want to leave Amelia on her own for too long. Mid-June? All July in UK.

Had little breakthrough with exam format (you are more creative on tea than coffee): they get a whole deck of technical exercises to learn (solfege-technical ex-rhythms-scales) and when they book the exam they then have 24 hours to send video of them playing 3 random exercises from each with unique exam code in frame.

I am grateful for Regivaldo - imagine having to do all that donkey work yourself. I’m grateful for having a life where I can lie down for an afternoon nap if needed most days. 

I’m grateful for the days in the barn with the boys - wasn’t that magic? Don’t regret it. You had your time with the boys. Same friends that you made great music together with. Still friends though you need to reach out to Si and Dean. Man.

Things went off the boil a bit after that for about a decade. But now things are special again. Throw yourself into this mate! Make it happen - Favela Brass, world brass Carnival, grades in Brazil. Grab it all and go for it! You’re Tom Ashe you are! Hehehe

Struggling a bit with the grades. Mainly the solfege aspect. Very important that the whole learning experience, if not exactly fun, is rewarding musically. Scales, solfege, rhythm reading, technical exercises. That will put hairs on their chest. But it’s pretty dry. Any way to do it via tunes?

Joe left to go to the states for 3 months today. Be great for him to get a vaccine and get out of lockdown. I can see me staying till mid June, then Mexico City, NYC, home for July.

I’m grateful for having a double bass to play now! I’m grateful to be able to wake up and see trees every morning.

I’m grateful for these great courses audio books on classical music. Bach at the mo. But it’s exactly the kind of education you want to get - like having a free music history university course.

Recording for BBC News yesterday. Not your finest hour: first you get the time difference the wrong way round so it ends up being at 6am, then on the day you don’t pick up that the zoom setting for getting risk of noise suppression has to be activated within each call as well as within the app. Lesson: slow down!

Also made the house in Engenho do Mato decision and will buy this week. Price came down from 390 to 340 (I think we could have got it for less). In terms of the worries, it’s mainly that you’ll end up investing loads in a place that faces the wrong way for sun, and that the reforms will cost an arm and a leg.

Thinking about maybe going slow: doing each stage of reforms when you have the cash in order to avoid debt and reduce stress.

2022

Show at Hedi’s with the kids. Darlan’s first outing. New banner looks cool. Just need to focus on new tunes one or two at a time so they get to the point that they are actually ready 

2021

The aha moment came (coffee for cranking tea is for creating). Instead of solfege they do musical enrichment - the good part of JRI. That hits the spot and it fun/musical. Maybe make it even easier with figurenotes.

Had a good lesson with marquinho and Rafa up at the Assuncao - they are both dying of “saudades” for the glory days. Dude, stick with it. Brazil is magic. Do the exam board with Ed but keep your focus here. Be loyal to Brazil, be loyal to the community, be loyal to Favela Brass. Stop looking around.

I am grateful for all of the amazing people who donate instruments to favela brass  (including the most recent double bass). You have created something that attracts nice people and invites generous acts. That’s very cool.

I am grateful for having a great life’s purpose outside myself, and I’m grateful for the almost limitless piano sheet music that is out there for me to get my teeth into.

Churrasco with Thamires, Kenny, Tom TBS, Sofia, Joe and crazy Ukrainian Airbnb guest Viktoria. Good times. Did whisky, lemon, rosemary and honey recipe for the first time.

Stressed as hell with work. Trying to get the board to put Pam in as ED but they are dragging their feet. It’s just endless meetings about stuff that you shouldn’t be concerned with.

You love pushing things to the limit in a straight line. The discipline, stretching. What you don’t like is being pulled in all directions at the same time. Maybe you’re more of a Patten than an Eisenhower.

Meeting with Raissa about admin and Rouanet project. Show with a reduced turma 2 at Lagoa. See Cash again - this guy could be a great board member - and also meet Barbara from EARJ and Caren from the American Society. Van driver Patricia freaks out and I have to ride back down to laranjeiras with her.

Still thinking of Dad. Still hurts. Just think of the negative photo roll.

Watching Fargo series 2.

Today’s Sunday. On Friday the top part of the housing for the water tanks fell down and part of the wall fell through the roof below. A tree had been gradually leaning into the wall and Regivaldo had already noticed that it was caving.

Got the debris out of next to the kitchen with Regivaldo fairly quick, water pipes upstairs are fixed (though shower is still slow) and Antonio has gone at the offending tree (and others) with a chain saw. But, obviously, the thing is the asbestos. 

In the UK the whole house would be sealed off and then it would have to be cleaned by men in space suits. As it was it was you and regivaldo with flimsy masks on taking the stuff out, shortly after it happened and you’re still living in the house. I guess just get the roof sorted, clean the shit out of the house and forget about it.

Booked the epic trip back via Mexico and NYC. Also came up with exam format of just technical studies and transposition. Also thought about possibility of selling books on teachers pay teachers. Nathan did the first page of transposition using Figurenotes yesterday and this is clearly the way.

I’m grateful for films, I’m grateful fir good beer (even just being able to buy a half decent Stella at Claudio’s). I’m very grateful for having the audible/good headphones - just think how many books you wouldn’t have had time to read without this combination.

Money. Listened to the Morgan Housel, author of The Psychology of Money on the Art of Manliness podcast on Sunday and have had it at the back of my mind since. The iron rule for wealth is to “Live within your means and be patient.” and the key thing is to start saving early, ideally from age 10 like Warren Buffet. Great. At 41 without savings or a decent income the best I can say is that at least I have a house (that I didn’t earn). Technically, I could go indefinitely with both rooms rented out.

In your late twenties you read The Millionaire Next Door and Rich Dad, Poor Dad. You knew. Problem was that you just didn’t have the income over expenses until starting at the British School. From 2017 you could have saved money though. Think about the trips to America and Europe. All those meals out. Also the slowness to get the new house up to scratch and rented. And now you’ve quit the British School and turned down the American School.

So other than printing out the cashflow quadrant and sticking it under your glass desk, what can you do now? Been listening to Marco Pierre White and Gordon Ramsey making huge sums of money. You don’t need all that, but you need to get going. Maybe it’s a bit more simple - maybe you just need to get some decent cash into Favela Brass, do a great job as ED and ask for a decent salary in return. Live within your means, save 10% of your income and invest time and money into income bearing assets, like rental property in Rio.

You spent your 20s looking at your belly button and your 30s having the time of your life in Rio. Point is, you have to be realistic about where your choices have left you. In many ways they have left you in a fantastic place - so much freedom, so much fun to be had in Rio, such an amazing project. But they also mean that you’re kind of committed. You have to run with this now. No more dreaming of landing a cushy job in academia or making a billion dollar app. You have to think that Executive (and musical )Director of Favela Brass is the best (and most important) job in the world, and you have to realise that crushing the job that you are doing is the best thing you can do for your future, financial and otherwise. I.e. Love the one you’re with.

That said… if the key is getting cash into Favela Brass, then how are you going to do that? Rouanet, editais, UK Charity status etc. But how are you going to build the giving network to hit the really big donors. Again it’s about doing the simple things well. Thankyous, newsletters, well thought-out fundraisers. Great performances by the kids in the right places and plenty of videos on Social Media. You also have to say yes to stuff, to push past the fear, to be a bit bold in terms of getting the kids noticed. You also need to take the initiative and build a team. Stop being a perfectionist about this. Look around you - who can take stuff on? Amelia, Joe, Raissa, Dan Lassen. Think! 

Also be strategic. Get these partnerships with the private schools going, including Leandro’s. Use the arrangements to structure exchanges and start a little youth brass movement. That first 90 minutes on arranging is the most important time, the wildly important time. That’s where the musical vision is laid out. That’s the part that only you in the whole world can do. And once an arrangement is done it’s done. Once a body of arrangements is done it’s done, giving every brass band in the world a blueprint to follow.

And maybe if you do get Favela Brass working like a well-oiled machine, if instead of looking for a way around you go straight through, then maybe in a few years time you’ll be able to hand over the reins to capable lieutenants and pursue another related option that presents itself to you. But you have to make Favela Brass a success first, to establish it. This is your calling card, your passport, whatever you want to call it.

Crazy day yesterday. Met a very crazy and sexy girl called Hinali off tinder for a suco date at 7:30 in the morning, then give lesson at CIEP, then did British School show at Barra, then the lanterna festival at the German school. All went well and Hinali is currently asleep in my bed in her knickers.

The British School plan for next year should be a big concert at both site for Class 3, followed by the opportunity to sign up for the band program premium course. Maybe R$50 - R$100 to have the melodica/perc lessons after school. Kids do end of term shows with Favela Brass and also TBS events.

When the students hit class 4 if they want to continue with the BPP they pay a little more and have private lessons on tpt/trom/sax with the Band Program teachers. This would create a differential within the C4 band program, but the dynamic could be one of the premium students helping the others.

The could move you a step further towards where you want to be: running Rio de Janeiro’s music service. Time to put all this on paper then present it to Melissa, Jose Costa and senior management, and then PTA. Then just need to get out of normal C4 band lessons.

Interesting that 4 years later Favela Brass has come on a lot but there’s still work to do in the professionalism department. Cris and the parents (not just Cris’s fault), monitoring of the kids, contracts and proper job descriptions for the staff. In the middle of this situation with Carol, Dani and Geiza declaring war on the project. Having difficulty getting to a decision.

Free consulting session with Karina yesterday in her WeWork in Botafogo. She explained how a Brazilian associação sem fins lucrativos works and said that we can get Joe a 2-year visa to work for us as a part of the diretoria. Her approach seems to put a big emphasis on professionalism and doing things right.

[looking back: this meeting did make a difference for you. She was right in terms of the need for a decent website, a decent business card, and for you to be the one selling the project. This was part of the start of you really taking on the Executive Director role. Her question about why things don’t move forward with you has also come to mind on more than one occasion.]

Results for the Fomento à Todas as Artes (R$50.000) came out and we placed 26 out of about 200 (only 20 get the cash). Looks like we got a perfect score for everything except location. Will try to do an appeal but seems unlikely. Made the mistake of splashing it around the diretoria group - it’s good to feed them the big news items, but the risk is of you looking needy, or of them getting involved.

In general you need to stop leaking. Stop blabbing. Stop coming across as needy. Stop giving things away. Remember law 4:

“When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. . . The more you say, the less likely you are to say something foolish.”

Also, there’s this poem that Rockefeller, who was famously quiet in meetings, used to quote, apparently:

“There was an owl liv'd in an oak
The more he heard, the less he spoke
The less he spoke, the more he heard.
O, if men were all like that wise bird”

(From Punch, 1875)

Take the example of Marco Pierre White. To uphold standards and discipline you can’t be a lightweight piece of fluff. You need to plant you feet and hold the line. You need to develop habits around this.

Didn’t drink the whisky last night and slept MUCH better. Straight through 10 - 5 with the ear protectors on.

Did a bit of preparing teaching slides for the first time in ages. Went back into David Newell’s rhythm teaching book and it clicked - that 1-i-and-a system is the way to go because it ties syllables in with the actual counting of beats. He explains why it’s better than du tá de ta and you only understood this time.

On the morning walk refined the idea of having them practice rhythms at the start of lessons that will prepare them for the graded sign reading tests. So all you need is the slides and the graded sight reading studies. Although you could put videos together later as well.

Norton and co came round for lunch at abcd. Went fine - it does seem like they are connected, but they are also new to captação, and to you. Have to avoid paying them commission for our donors. Fátima is saying the next project shouldn’t be 1 million but that we should work up to it. Makes sense.

New series of the crown on Netflix. Episode about Mountbatten’s death got you thinking about Dad. That’s going to be very tough when it comes. I don’t like the idea of him not seeing his grandkids. Like I let him down, and Mum as well. This part of your life has to move forward.

Mad scramble yesterday to get signatures to prove you have students outside of centro/zona sul, as an appeal against our 2/5 points for location in the fomento às artes grant (R$50k). Unlikely to change anything but still, very happy that they scored the rest of our application 20/20.

In the evening went out for pizza and drinks in Leblon with Kenny and Joe. Was really nice to get out. Kenny is a great person to have as a friend. Exactly the kind of guile-less person that the existentialism guy Robert Marino was talking about on the Art of Manliness podcast. Look after this friendship. All cool with joe at the mo as well.

Playing music as a hobby. If you want a great leisure activity you don’t need to look further than working on Bach chorales through the keys at the piano. When you were a kid school was work and you managed to do a lot of practice once school was over (or before school). You would write music weekends and evenings and it wasn’t work. Now you’ve found the first 90 minutes of the day for writing which is great and I guess that’s half work. Trumpet and piano (and sax and trombone and whatever instruments you want to learn) should feel like hobbies. Practice can still be rigorous and scheduled - you can still stretch -  but somehow it has to feel like leisure. Nothing sorts your head out like a couple of hours at the piano.

2020

I think we can call today a draw. Very lethargic in the morning and even ended up napping but still got stuff done and didn’t eat too much which was good. Hit the basics - meditation, workout, piano, trumpet and meeze - and the rest is a bonus. Also hit on a good routine of finishing at 6pm and then walking down to Flamengo beach and then back up via Santa Teresa whilst listening to potential tunes for the brass band.

Great talk yesterday with Ed Matkin. Takeaways were:

1. Rouanet will involve massive amounts of paperwork - need to pay Carola to handle that full-time.
2. He has a “puppet” board of 10 chums rather than a proper one - your project will have a differential.
3. You must keep your nose clean, cross all your t’s and dot all your i’s because at some point somebody is going to come for you.
4. Sign-off is the important thing when delegating. Need to keep produtoras on a short leash.
5. Other states seem to have bands in the schools - Rio is unusual.
6. Avoid getting entangled with politicians at all costs - must stay independent.

Also chatted to Bill Ballantayne and he’s up for a chat about setting up our board. Seeing Sandra later today to talk about the whole board thing. More than a little worried that she’s going to be crazy at board meetings/overbearing. Perhaps not the best choice with hindsight.

Have booked a whole table for the TBS Christmas Celebration. Pricey, but good to be able to show the FB team that I value their work, and to be seen to be contributing to the BCS. Since the proceeds from the event got to us it ends up being a donation to Favela Brass anyway…

Medium day. Finished Shining Lights (which I think could be my first decent brass band arrangement) and got stuck into Odara. Right now finishing a decent brass band arrangement feels like the best result to have in my hand at the end of a day.

Long chat to Fatima and really feeling confident that we’re going to get funded. Have to decide what the next Rouanet projects will look like after this one. And also what the project might look like in a more funded form. Something about rouanet seems to encourage waste. How can we use this money to actually make our school better?

Having an eerie feeling about what it will be like to write this diary in 2060. That day will come, you will be writing that diary. Not only that, you will be reading this one. It’s the courageous decisions that make you proud, the strength to go out and do what you think is right. And to live. Your most shameful time was your 20s - your anti role model is uncle Paul. Somewhere between him and Marco Pierre White you need to hit your stride.

November 4th 2020

Favelagrafia want to do a recording with the kids. They want 10 kids from turma 1 to record a tune somewhere in a favela, but then it starts to become unclear.

It’s something to do with a commercial for Boticário but he’s saying that the commercial has already been made and this is an “acao em conjunto”. When I asked about COVID he said we’d be wearing gloves.

When I asked about cash they said there would be money for the kids. Didn’t even consider the possibility that the project should get some cash. And they have started by talking to the lads in fogueteiro and saying there might be cash which doesn’t help.

Also the reference they sent was when you wish upon a star with Louis Armstrong which is all strings and vocal. Some of silly talk about “abrindo vozes” and assuming that I will do an arrangement for free. And the magic line about exposure for the project.

All in all not ideal but 2 problems for dismissing it: wouldn’t be good for relationship with kids in Fogueteiro or with Favelagrafia (who have already done us a favor), local project etc. Also, it’s you saying no to stuff, holding the project back from doing stuff.

Very tempted to just recommend them a string project in the nicest possible way. Would be nice to help them, but once we’ve said yes I’m worried they will take the piss in terms of COVID and how long we have to play for. And also, is this really going to work?

So there you have it. A nice juicy leader’s dilemma. Enough to stress you out and mess with your sleep last night. Mental note: you hate this stuff.

End of day update: you turned it around. Came up with the idea of sexta básicas to avoid the money issues, wrote the arrangement, set the location, spoke to the parents. Mental note: you love this stuff.

Blue Note finally paid so I’m ok for cash. Part of me thinks I should have got out of the British School this year. Financially it’s doable now. Trying to think of a project for next year that could get me working in a better capacity with the British and American schools. Carnival melodica and percussion blocos. Paid extra-curricular activity? (they might take it more seriously if they pay)

Saturday was Amit’s fun run at the Lagoa. As predicted hardly anyone participated (BCS demographics), but it was good networking. Nice to have a beer with Amit and Bill afterwards.

Friday took Joy to Bar dos Descasados. She’s obviously very sexual - i.e. likes sex! And although she has clearly been reading from the same hymn sheet as Talita in terms of feminism etc.. she is a lot more chilled out and cooperative, which was the point all along.

Yesterday picket up bracelets from Alison Correa and asked her if she wants to be on the board for Favela Brass which she didn’t seem to be sure about. Then went to Santa Teresa with Kenny to try and get a gig at Favela Hype but the manager wasn’t there. Life is good.

Rewatched Midnight in Paris. I can’t remember if I got before how in the end Gil finds love in the present and not the past once he stops trying to escape it, but I realize now what an effect the film had on you at the time - and its continuing relevance for you. 

The thing is that we really are in a time of cultural stagnation now - nothing of note has happened musically in the last 20 years. That’s your purpose right there - to do something to move the dial on that. You’re never going to bring back the Jazz age, but you could get people playing the latest hits in the street, and you can get some very cool funk brass culture going in the favelas.

An interesting aha moment when Robert Greenberg said that the invention of amplified music had profound consequences - including the death of mass amateur live music-making. Isn’t that what is coming back in Rio? You can’t have a (good) bloco without people playing instruments.

Another aha moment is this thing about hiring people to execute your projects. Almost a franchise-type thing. Can almost imagine Favela Brass taking other projects over. Think Napoleon just giving his groups of troops objectives then letting them attain them in the best way they think possible.

Ah and we got approval for Lei Rouanet today. 

2020

Recording of “When you wish upon star” with kids for Favelagrafia today. Went absolutely fine. Kids played ok not perfect from a COVID perspective but certainly nothing to keep you awake at night. Lots of other kids in the quadra - definitely good for getting them interested.

Did mess up on the logistics front. No water for the kids and the toilet at the Quadra didn’t work. You have to be looking out for the kids all the time, they are the important ones for the project. Now Gabi is back in the project the complainers are back don’t give them anything to whinge about.

Been thinking that the daily burner might be a good approach. Guess the problem is there are too many burners but should be able to whittle it down. 

Long walk today and after I came back on the road, after practicing trumpet on the rock, a group of cyclists were looking at me. They had seen the trumpet and had realised that it was me playing before. Told me how the sound echoed round the whole area and how much they liked it. Was so nice to hear 

2019

Been quite stressed about Carola the last few days. To put it bluntly, she’s generally been a bit bossy without necessarily having the instincts and commitment to let me hand off things to her. Things that would be simple to to resolve with Joe become interminable - plus, email lists, event planning. The tendency is to be putting things on paper that don’t happen, and to end up with a Google Drive full of documents that are out of date or forgotten before they are ever used.

The title of “produtora”seems to imply the person responsible for setting out and elaborating a project. The title of director seems to overlap this a lot. Perhaps approval is a useful tool here: as director, you need the board to approve your plan; as produtora, whatever Carola does should need to be approved by you.

Putting Sandra on the board might not have been the smartest move because a) she is buddies with Carola (who latched on to her at the last Curry) and b) she likes to use her money as an instrument of power.

Perhaps the line for the board is this: I need to delegate many of the functions of Favela Brass. However, one function that I cannot delegate is the coordination of the delegation process. We want Carola in charge of projects, but not the project.

Met with Lucas and Walter about our institutional video yesterday - Lucas seems a bit crazy/bossy, but they seem pretty serious. TBS Christmas lunch meeting afterwards and they have decided to support Favela Brass for the event.

Joyce is becoming a contender, she’s much more chill than Talita, ver sexy and smart with a good sense of humour. Having said that had a very funny conversation with Hinali yesterday and just about to meet her for coffee at 7:20 in the morning in Cinelândia before the CIEP lesson.

Sandra is going hell for leather to tell people to sign up for our benfeitoria - sounds like she’s going to be a great board member! Alison Correia asked me to go to her house on Sunday to talk more. I’m busy reading up on the structure of NGOs.

Things looking better now - stress is gone. Stay off the coffee, on the exercise and on the meditation.

Complained about the road noise and Noélia, my Airbnb host, has offered the top floor flat for no extra. Hopefully moving today and it looks like a big improvement. Spent last night looking at other possible destinations in the North East - very tempting to extend this trip. Only real considerations are the project and Joe. Joe coming with is a possibility.

Adrienne is proving to be an absolute star. Made her prawn curry yesterday then she took me to the stand up rowing place. Now really looking forward to the excursion to the Canyon, Croa do Gorê, etc. Thinking about how this could be a good place to retire - so cheap to buy and live, and also relatively secure.

Working on the audio to Amelia’s video. The business of the kids that I forgot has soured it a bit but hey ho - stick with the mantra and concentrate on winning today.

Discovered a great book today via the AOM podcast: Work Clean by Dan Charnas, all about applying the principle of mise en place that chefs learn to other working situations. Have spent pretty much all day (post arranging time) listening to it and making notes. A lot rings true about the importance of process tasks. Really want to use it to make a change and get organized.

In tidying up files I saw the reams that I had written about MLT. Not entirely time wasted, but you took all that stuff far too seriously for far too long.

October 18th, 2020 - Aracaju

This is why the Mise en Place philosophy is so important:

Think of all the time you spent trying to find the educational equivalent of the “lost chord” with 3-4 hours of MLT noodling every day first thing - your best time. All those unfinished files, all those turma 1 rehearsals with no new tunes and all that working for free because you hadn’t taken care of the business and outreach side of things. Not to mention the mess. And leaving Talita in bed alone on Sunday mornings.

Part of the problem was being taken in by MLT itself, but part of the problem was also not prioritizing activities with an eye to what is expected as part of YOUR JOB. *Deep Work *is a great book, but it works as a philosophy for one part of your job - the immersive work. For you to be on top of things - which is really what you want, and what everyone else expects of you - you have to adjust the ratio of immersive and process work in your schedule to achieve that. 

And perhaps even more important you have to think about how you want to live you life. If you had to say whether you have been working clean or dirty these last 6 years, you would have to say that you have been working dirty, and your physical spaces reflect this. Your reputation also reflects this. You are in a situation where you have to have your sh*t together before you can start thinking about doing the creative stuff. 

This year was supposed to be about the management side of things and the mise en place approach is your ticket to getting out of the weeds. Did the first mise yesterday at 16:30, just tidied the hotel room up, but it’s a start, a commitment. Let’s do this!

Back in Rio now and enjoying getting down to business with the new mise en place approach. Spent the morning tidying and setting up my station, then the afternoon at the Banco do Brasil with Márcia trying to get to the point where I can make payments from the internet banking (with mixed success). Liking the system whereby I have 7 Favela Brass “burners” on the go at once - one for each aspect of the job.

Almost feeling disillusioned with the Deep Work philosophy that you took to heart so much. The thing is that in fact the one big amazing thing that is wildly important here is the success of Favela Brass, which depends you getting organised and keeping all the plates in the air. Not long interrupted stretches of time going deep into one thing. Of course you need this time, but don’t fetishise it - look at what’s expected of you in your job and get it done whatever it is.

Maybe in 10 years time you will be an academic, or an arranger. But right now you’re a coordinator first.

Typical. Cancelled Turma 1 show at arpoador because of a crap weather forecast and we end up with blazing sun. The worst feeling! 

Amelia just finished the institutional video which i still think has a pregnant pause in the middle. Camila being frustrating - taking forever to respond to stuff and being super bolshy to boot.

Yesterday found out that we have serious contrapartida social issues. Fátima put that we would do our encontros with not just state school students and teachers, but state school MUSIC students and teachers. Which puts us in the shit. 5 of them:

2020

Finished voce partiu meu coração arrangement and chipped away at the admin and organizing. On the right track now. Couple of things making me think...

When I was on the bank with Marcia she opened Mangueirinha’s Banco do Brasil account and there was R$130k in there. You’re playing the fool financially. Get a grip on your own finances.

Asked Claudio for a depoimento for this edital ações locais. Just dawned on me that he might have thought that I was asking for help. Not good. 

That thought came to me after watching a Robert Greene / Ryan Holiday YouTube clip which finished with them talking about the importance of keeping a clean nose. What was almost forgotten is coming back: you are compromised, and as was pointed out very well, once you are compromised you are forced to lie - you are no longer yourself.

The solution, of not being compromised, is no longer open. So what do you do? 

A bit worried about Joe - he’s just practicing the whole time.

Main thing: everything went smoothly at the polícia federal at Santos Dumont and you still have a visa to stay in this beautiful country and live this amazing life. Now that is something to be grateful for.

Still going through the chef phase and watching the Netflix kitchen something series. Inspiring Argentinian chef today - so far they have all been courageous free spirits. Just started reading the fear is fuel book which I can tell is going to be great. From a cowardly academic to a courageous chef - wouldn’t that be a step in the right direction?

Spend a lot of the day yesterday thinking about how we could arrange the lessons next year (as well as getting the basics done). Actually turned out pretty well, have to make sure it gets remembered. Will give an intake of 120 students every term, and hopefully a nice long waiting list for instrument lessons, as well as school bands, school baterias and a bateria geral.

Went to Kenny’s BBQ at Leo’s house in Chácara do Céu. Was great to have a play, but found it difficult in terms of people’s lack of caution with COVID. It rained so people went inside and we ended up with about 12 people in a room close up together without masks. I stayed outside mainly or at least next to the door before leaving pretty early. Felt bad about not inviting Joe.

Still, had a productive conversation with the activities coordinator at the American school which hopefully will lead to a joint initiative with favela brass. They couldn’t find a new head of music so Bob (who was at the party and as charming as ever) is still there even though he’s clearly not liked.

Stuck to 2 small beers - the alcohol frees really help with this. Even just the hint of a hangover gets me uptight nowadays.

Long, productive day. Finished off exam rubrics, did loads of admin, practiced, cycled, just didn’t do any arranging.

Camila frikking annoying. Thinking about taking her off communications coordination. Just takes forever to respond, super passive aggressive and whinges about everything.

Booked tickets to Miguel Pereira - bookmarked a lot of houses including in Paty do Alfares: a part of me wonders if this was what the dreams were about. Not another neighborhood of santa but the interior.

Wait. What if the whole point of life is to take it seriously - to find something that you’re willing to die for. I’d risk death to put right the things with dad. It all matters. If human happiness and suffering are real and they matter then what we do doing our lives IS significant, whether it’s a grain of the sand on the beach or not.

Maybe there’s something more to this heading up to the hills thing.

Been thinking about this possibility of working with the private schools. It does seem possible, but you have to be realistic about the amount of work it will create. Needs to be lucrative so that you can hire the help you need, and so the extra work pays off for you. 

Will has “formally invited” me and Joe to a barbecue on the balcony of his apartment which I don’t want to go to. Bored of doing socials that put us at risk of spreading Covid. It’s a catch 22 - if he doesn’t invite anyone except me and Joe it will be a long evening, if the apartment is full of people it’s going to be a long evening.

Morning Will, thank you for invite to the BBQ me and Joe are just a bit wary about socialising indoors still. I know that you have the balcony but we’re just trying to be really careful. Really keen to catch up properly soon though - hope you can understand and don’t think we’re being OTT!

Up at 4 today (with the help of coffee). Really wanting to leave the British School - yesterday was so nice with time at home to get on top of Favela Brass Stuff. Kenny has put in a good word for me at the American school, but they told him I wasn’t qualified, basically. However, looks like I’ll get an interview.

A feeder system of melodica and percussion into a Saturday morning oficina would be the best. Or melodicas feeding into extra-curricular private lessons and a weekly after-school band.

The opportunity of a pro brass band has to be pursued, and with zeal. This is your career path for your kids, and motivation for older kids to practice. It is also your ticket for promoting live music, and for your own artistic expression. This should be a good 50% of it for you. The question is whether to hire a manager or do the production in house.

Private lessons on Mondays in Pereira are making a lot of sense. The 3-contact model is a good one - private (or at least homogenous) lesson, group rehearsal, and keyboard/melodica + theory lesson.

Las night was the night when you invited Kenny, Joe and Sandra to Karina’s birthday party at Flor do Ceu, then Karina went crazy and you ended up running for your life. Food and company was fantastic until about 10pm and then the rest you know…

I like Kenny’s idea of celebrating the anniversary of near-death escapes so the 29th of October marks the day I escaped narrowly with my life from the Chacara do Ceu favela.

Spent yesterday putting together our application for the R$50.000 Aldir Blanc grant - fingers crossed! Also wrote “Chama Ela/Baila Congo” arrangement that actually turned out ok. Slowly getting it into my thick head that these charts need to be playable by turma 1 - that’s your band! The ideal is to be a cross between Sammy Nestico and Quincy Jones!

Listening to “Devil in the Kitchen”, the autobiography of chef Marco Pierre White. Very entertaining and basically a collection of his funny stories. No matter how bad the situation, if you get a funny story out of it then it’s ok!

October 8th, 2020

Quite a bit has happened. Moved out of the dodgy Airbnb with the road noise and into the hotel. Expensive (R$95/night for 14 nights), but so worth it. Just fantastic to wake up, run by the sea, take a dip, meditate, then have a hotel breakfast and work all day in a quiet air-conditioned room. Mental note: hotels are where it’s at!

Things went a bit funny with Adrienne. I took a step back in terms of not seeing her every day and on Sunday she was almost insisting on coming round and in my caffeine-withdrawn state I just didn’t fancy it (pretty much off the caffeine now, except for a morning green tea and not even that today). She went very monosyllabic on the phone messages I think the best you can hope for from this is some good make-up sex.

Board-wise things looking better. Nice long chat with Melissa including going through the whole Carola situation, which she was supportive of. The board approved my pay as of this month and Dan Lassen has made a R$20k donation to us - unbelievable. Ed Matkin is talking about trying to do the Curitiba trip at the end of the year, but I think that’s a bit tight with Corona.

The main downer at the moment though is my visa situation. I forgot about renewing my CRNM until Aracaju was booked and the expiry date was 2 weeks away. I then misunderstood what Joe was saying about the appointment page not working and probably missed the chance to get an appointment in Rio. The expiry has now passed and I can only sort this out at Santos Dumont in Rio when I get back in 2 weeks time. I just hope this doesn’t end up in a call to Karina.

Sat on the plane to Porto. Quite ambivalent about coming back to Brazil - could easily have stayed in the UK for longer. But this way you can give the project a push  with more melodica and recorder students and some personal contacts, you can travel in Brazil, and then you can do the UK again at Christmas. Was great seeing Charlotte and Rob - had a nice Indian take-away and watched the Brass for Africa film with them last night. Did spend the whole time worrying about giving everyone COVID though. Will breath a big sigh of relief in a weeks’ time assuming everyone is still okay.

Thursday morning it was great to see Jim Trott but really embarrassed about turning up empty-handed. Bottle of wine would have covered it. Anyway, the actual conversation went well and also met his wife, Pam, and daughter Gracie. Talked about him possibly letting us use his cargo allowance, lots of good advice about fundraising and bringing students over to the UK. Also the possibility of making a video together, and I tried to steer us away from doing a tune that’s too “colonial” without offending Jim.

Jim also gave me the link and password to the Brass for Africa doc. He watched gringo favela with family the same day but we only watched theirs yesterday, not ideal. Was a very nice doc and Jim really didn’t get featured much, to his credit - unlike in Favela Brass videos, which are often very centered on you. The project was impressive but I still get the impression they don’t really have the kind of solid network of local bands that their materials imply, and I’m not 100% that all of the musicians that came to the UK came through their project. Call me cynical but there’s still something not quite adding up.

The question that I am thinking about now is: if someone were to make a film about the next year or two at Favela Brass, what would be the story? It starts with COVID hitting and the kids playing at home, then there’s some spark because of COVID and going online, which throws sets us on a quest which gets sorted in 2022.

COVID sparks:
Making videos with other groups
Talking to other band directors

Quests:
Why can’t kids have their carnival to look forward to every year?
Make a world bloco in Brazil
A world youth street music carnival, (that then goes to other countries?)

What about... a joint video with kids in street music projects to kick things off?

Who could be in it?

Favela Brass
Brass for Africa
Rebel Brass
Project Ladywood (Birmingham Symphony Hall)
Kinetica Bloco
Batukavi (Grenoble percussion group)
DYJA
Roots of Music (New Orleans 
Samba Y Bamba
Youthsayers  
Alegro
School of Honk

In London and been a bit rubbish about writing the diary. Saw Ed and Dan for a curry on Tuesday which was great - restaurant was doing a two for one offer as well. Bonus. Dan has 2 kids and Ed 3 and sounds like they have mixed feelings about the whole thing. You could be in a much worse predicament. Should have kept contact better - especially with Ed. Got a lift back with Ed and regretted it - even though COVID is much less prevalent at the mo you should have walked for your Dad’s sake.

Yesterday met Dennis Macdonagh for lunch which turned in to just drinking outside a pub near convent garden. Very glad to have this one beer rule. He’s the same old Dennis and very keen to make amends with the DYJO lot and John Ellis. Same wandering but entertaining conversation as ever. Another friend that you could have reached out to a lot sooner.

Went for beer (you) / beers (him) with Andy Casterton later. Great to catch up and talk about British school stuff and his job as head of music at St. Paul’s school and the incredibly elite students that he is teaching there. Went for pizza and then Rich Fletcher came down a bit later. Rich has got a girlfriend now which is brilliant and is getting into coding as well so interesting to chat to him about that. Uber back with face mask and window open didn’t feel too risky.

Been staying in the Penn club which is very nice - lovely breakfast with berries, yoghurt and muesli. Coffee with Shaleena this morning at pret a manger on highbury corner. She’s pretty much better from the disease that she had but has hurt her back recently. Now working on homicide and had a fairly grisly tale to tell about the current case that she was about to attend court for. Offered to take the kids to 10
Downing Street if we get them over in 2022.

Which reminds me that I didn’t write about
going to Birmingham Symphony Hall to see Chris Procter on Monday. Was a bit of a faff getting in because it was all closed but the hall is amazing and Chris seemed to be very positive about being able to get funding for the possible 2021 trip. Have to commit to this 2022 if it’s actually going to happen and it will take a lot of time effort. 

Been thinking about the Carola thing (for a change) and strongly feel that she has to go. Asked her to put Stuart MacDonald’s donated French Horn on Ebay which may turn out to be a mistake. After completely disappearing she suddenly starts sending shitty messages to the musicians about the importance of the register and complaining that they aren’t getting back to her. Maybe put her to one day a week on writing grants and see how that goes. As leader, you have to sort this.

Also... did a New York Brass Band gig in Harrogate on Sunday. Messed up my bit - completely spaced and passed my solo to Dan after James had announced that the piece would feature me. Went to Stu Macdonald’s after and he donated 2 trombones and a load of accessories to the project. He also said that he’s quitting the shop and quite happy just to be rid of his stock. Why did you involve Carola in such an important aspect of the project?

So just on the train to WokingHAM now to see Jim Trott and about to commit the cardinal sin that you said you would never commit again - i.e. turn up empty-handed. Hoping that there’s a place to buy a bottle
of wine on the station. Awkward.

Been feeling pretty guilty the last couple of days about the fact that I have been out and about meeting people in the days up to meeting Mum, Dad, Charlotte and Rob. The viral load is low and all that, but it’s still an unnecessary risk. I guess just have to try to keep my distance from everyone as much as possible.

Been very tempted to just stay longer in the UK - it would also be the responsible thing to do as well because you would be spreading less COVID. But if you stay now you won’t want to be back for Christmas and also the melódica and recorder situation needs your attention in Rio. Very tempted to book a month in Aracaju and see Adrienne. Just not sure I want to end up with a girlfriendy situation there or abandon joe again. Decisions.

COVID seems to be starting to wane in Rio and Brazil but the numbers are still high. Just cannot wait to start seeing girls again and also take the kids to Curitiba. Dan Lassen sent a message this morning saying he may have a big donation but needs to know what it is for. Depending on the size, Curitiba may be ideal. Or getting Stu’s instruments over, instrument cases, music stands. Best set up a zoom.

Other good news: Rosa from Atados wants to help us with captação. This is great - do not let Carola anywhere near it.

We are massively behind with our Favela Brass meetings. Angelo needs to understand that as president he needs to see that the monthly meetings happen with or without him, and that things like the meeting with the accountant move forward with or without him. We have a vice-president exactly for if he has emergencies etc.

Also youth Projects in Rio:
Rocinha
Afro-Reggae

Ok so had a coffee in Porto airport and thought of a name: “Youth Brass United”? Could work if it’s an open social media account where everyone can post what they are up to. Could also do a wix to share resources - map of projects, charts, links to individual projects, social media accounts.

About:

“Youth Brass United is an alliance of music education projects from all over the world that play funky street brass band music. We provide our students with the opportunity to rehearse and perform together - whether that be online, or as part of international exchanges, and to learn about each other’s musical cultures through the sharing of educational resources.”

Back in Rio. On arrival it became clear that the Cariocas have tired of social distancing - people in the street drinking and partying without masks etc. - or as the driver said: “Ta tudo liberado agora”. So you’re going to have to go against the flow. The month in Aracaju is looking more tempting than ever - just a bit worried that you’ll spend the whole time worrying that you’re getting into a relationship with Adrienne (worrying about worrying - sounds like you!). Monitor was broken on arrival which is annoying because you knew you should have packed it better. Also means that you need another monitor if you’re going to travel.

Things looking ok with Joe. Used the daily beer quota to full effect yesterday and had a Stella with him after lunch at Claudio’s. Walked up to the rock up near corcovado, meditated and practiced trumpet yesterday. Great way to find center.

Talking of which woke up today thinking about the situation with Felipe. The conversation with Gerson and Ricardo. You were complicit and things could have turned out a lot worse. Not saying anything that day is, and should be, the low-point of your life - the thing you regret the most. Felipe is ok, but you need to think about what you could be doing or saying to keep it that way. You need to act in a way consistent with your loss of character from that time - to be more contrite. You appear better than you are at the moment and you need to work at both sides of that. Favela Brass should be less and less about you now - remember, your name could become a toxic liability at any moment but the project doesn’t have to go down with you.

Back in the saddle. Set up the Brainscape flashcards for Bach in all 12 keys. At the moment looks like 10 mins of learning to play new tunes in original key, then 10 mins playing tunes in random keys, then 5 mins of improvising in the style of random tunes in random keys. Did piano first thing today, don’t know if that’s lazy or good. Spent the rest of the day on admin stuff, specifically the Natura and Rouanet grants.

Have to decide whether I’m going to bump Carola down to one day a week (as of October) today. I think that could be a good idea. She won’t like being dropped from the rest of the project but she really should have thought of that. So tempting to hook up with one of the many hot girls from Tinder that want to meet up, or to go to Aracaju. Just a bit worried that I will end up needing the Aracaju money for something else. Even thought about if we could get turma 1 tested and do a trip this year. 

Got back on it with Hasfit yesterday. You’ve lost quite a bit of fitness - walking and cycling aren’t Hasfit.

Booked the trip to Aracaju yesterday. The Airbnb place that I was thinking of staying at got booked up and it occurred to me that it’s now or never - you won’t want to be in Aracaju in 5-6 weeks time when the Corona virus is likely on the wane. Seems like the Airbnb was a good deal (about R$1.800 the month) and the flight seemed good at R$800 with luggage, but now it looks like the luggage might not happen. Told Joe straight away and he seemed ok about it - extended a genuine offer to come visit for a week in the middle.

Later the same night started having the inevitable second thoughts - what will people think of me taking trips to the Northeast, especially given situation with Carola? Will it get really expensive at a time when I don’t have much income? Am I too far from the beach to enjoy it? What about the monitor situation? Will I spend the whole time worrying about the situation with Adrienne? It is irresponsible in terms of Covid? Will I get bored? Am I being unfair on Joe abandoning him again? What if Globo want to do a report on us and I have to be in Rio? How will I cope with a whole month without piano practice? Wouldn’t there have been a better option?

All of the above are reasonable concerns, but it’s good to work against your usual bias to chicken out of stuff. Go for it, make the most of it, ENJOY IT. Set yourself a nice ambitious WIG for the month and hit it for 6. Also, remember that Joe situation could get annoying again at any moment.

Told Carola that she’s down to one day a week as of next month and only working on grants now (maybe grants/applications would be the best definition). She wasn’t jumping for joy, but she didn’t complain either. Also spoke to Angelo and told him that he needs to pass things to Mirella when he gets too busy. He send an email to set up the accountant meeting but still hasn’t put a message in the Whatsapp group to sort out the next board meeting (hopefully next week).

Yesterday finished Youtube playlists and, after having a scare thinking I had lost the HD, started organizing the new Turma 1 repertoire. I think there will be a lot of medleys in there - you should be looking at building punchy 30-minute sets. This could be the project for Aracaju. You will have to write arrangements without resorting to recording, but this will be a good discipline - if orchestrators can “hear” on entire orchestra then you should be able to handle a brass band of instruments you already play.

Also made and sent video to Honk. 

Had another lovely walk up to the rock and a real moment listening to “Take it easy” by the Eagles after meditating, looking out across everything. Getting out at 3pm would be the perfect time, to catch the sunset up top. Can you get your working day finished by 3pm? In any case have to engineer as many of these walks as possible into the week - they are perfect for the afternoon lull and caffeine hangover and the thinking is really productive. As is the trumpet practice and listening to classical music on the way down (Dvorak at the mo) - struck me that classical music is from a time when people had longer attention spans, and that maybe it’s the listener that has to up their game. 

The Youth Brass United idea still seems a good one. I think it’s going to survive its week of quarantine and be worth talking to the others about.

Carola just quit via email. She’s going to try and start a new life in Portugal. So it’s done, and about as cleanly as you could have hoped for. The project now has R$1.360 coming in for other things, or maybe just to have a little headspace. This would seem like a reasonable time to put in a salary for yourself though Joe will no doubt be hoping to receive something as well.

Worried that Joe will try and free-ride on my Aracaju rental. Just tell him to keep it to a week or so i.e. don’t take the piss.

Started reading “How Ike led” - much more inspiring book and person than the Rockerfeller biography.

Had a very low-energy day yesterday - tried jacking myself up on lots of cups of tea but didn’t work. Getting back to Carola messed up morning routine let’s see if we can work that back. Confess that I may have listened to a certain song from the Wizard of Oz more than once in the last 24 hours.

Went for lunch with Mangueirinha yesterday - was fine, but reminded me that he too is one to be a little bit careful with. He said that Carola was “malandrinna”, but over the years he has also shown that he hasn’t exactly “got your back”. Keep the project moving forward and the grumblers in check.

2023

You haven’t been writing diaries recently. Pretty sure that’s down to 2 things - for one, you have less time alone stewing, and the other thing is that you’re less stressed and needing to get things straight in the diary.

Summing up recent stuff:

1. You’re loving the chalet with Thamires, and moving closer and closer to living together there. Just need to check that Thamires is up for this whole thing of getting married and having kids not long after.
2. Favela Brass a million times better (for you at least!) with Pam gone. Initial signs good with Patrícia, giving more work to Carol and about to hire Iris.
3. Writing going well - solid 90 minutos each and every day working (too much coffee helps), and just need to get recording stuff now.

2020

In Aracaju and questioning it a bit. Why are you spending R$3.000 to spend a month in a house next to a main road in a city that just has one massive long beach, that you’re not even right on (30 mins walk at least to the part where you can swim) getting into a thing with a girl that you will only have to get yourself out of afterwards, and making people jealous and fuelling the idea that you have money to burn?

Good question.. The rationale was really to escape from Joe and have a nice month by the beach, a lot of fun with Adrienne, and get stuff done. That being the original mission, let’s go with that. Stop whingeing. Tell Joe the place is not suitable for 2 (which it isn’t - the road thing was actually a piece of luck). Find a way to get yourself to the beach for a run or long walk and a swim each day either first thing or in the afternoon. Have loads of sex with Adrienne and don’t overthink it, and work your ass off.

Possible timetable:

5: Up, coffee, diary, bit of trumpet

6: Down to work (WIG 1a) - 6:45 Bach Trumpet Break

Been thinking a bit about Mangueirinha again. Don’t forget that he’s a bully who disrespects you in private and even in public and isn’t loyal. Don’t write him off but remember that it wasn’t just Carola…

September 24th, 2020

Things are looking up. Went to the beach for sunset yesterday with whisky and agua de coco, just fantastic. Warm water, hardly any people and a seemingly endless stretch of beach to run up and down. Have to get in the sea every day that I possibly can here (barring rainy days, obviously). Looks like routine is going to be work till about 3pm then go to the beach. Get running in, because you are now feeling short of energy because of the lack of exercise recently.

Favela Brass admin is starting to pile up a bit - getting the accounts done in the new format ready for the meeting Friday, keeping on top of current editais, writing new Rouanet, etc. At the next meeting you should be asking to match Mangueirinha’s salary, with recent expenditures being taken into account. You have taken on Carola’s work so this really shouldn’t be too contentious.

Another thing struck me: don’t be the person who can’t get things done without going back to ask for permission for everything. Think Eisenhower - take command, present results, don’t be a baby.

Had a bit of a down day on Thursday, but got better after eating properly (including carangueijo and pastel de aratu) on the Orla. Adrienne is as nice a woman as you could ask for - take it easy, try not to create huge expectations and just roll with it. Have to say finding out she’s had silicone implants was a bit of a passion-killer.

Yesterday morning did things properly - out for run on the Orla at 5:30, jumped in the sea and meditated on the beach. Lovely. Came home and basically worked straight through from 8am till the meeting with the board at 8pm with breaks, desperately trying to get our accounts in order. 

Came to the meeting tired and irritable and although it went OK, we still only really scratched the surface. We haven’t had a meeting for 3 months and we need to meet much more often. Put the UK charity thing on the table but they just ummed and ahhhed about it. They were suggesting that we pay someone to write our grants, but not mention was made of the fact that I’m still not paid. Maybe best to make these points to Angelo.

Amelia finished the video and then the issue of the videos that the kids sent in via WhatsApp came up - Artu, Davi, Raissa. Amelia wants to put them in, but I just don’t think it’s worth her starting again - the quality is rubbish anyway. Anyway, you cocked up, is the bottom line.

Bit of an off day yesterday. Falsely accused Carola of owing us one more month of salary than she actually does. Not good. Later on was a zombie for Adrienne, who kept asking you what was up (to be fair this got a bit annoying). Feeling stressed and lethargic. Pretty sure that the coffee is at the root of this (and lack of exercise, also possibly the constant road noise at home). Time to get off coffee - bought some green tea in the hope this will bring things down gently.

Also a bit stressed about cash. Spending far too much on restaurant bills at the moment - have to rein that in (having said that yesterday at Rendeiro with the guitarist was special). Wrote my job description for the board with my 9 main functions and tomorrow will let Angelo know that I want the question of my pay on the agenda. I think I basically need to just hit the basics - lots of exercise, less/no caffeine, meditation maybe even no booze, in order to get back on track.

Played pretty much all of the 28 Bach tunes in the beginner book on trumpet yesterday - to continue this and start putting them round the key would be a great Aracaju goal.

Have come up with the idea of telling Carola that we’re going to re-evaluate in a months’ time. Not as drastic as firing her outright, means you will be giving her criticism direct, leaves your options open, seems fairer and also should get some decent work out of her this month. It’s a conversation that definitely requires some preparing.

Mangueirinha sent this Lei Aldir Blanc on Monday afternoon and I delayed before sending it to Carola until Tuesday morning. Not good, as the deadline was Monday 5pm in Brazil but not such an issue as the deadline has been put back. Without wanting to shift blame, why is Mangueirinha sending me this and not Carola? Same thing with another edital that someone sent me.

Had a really nice moment yesterday with the folks drinking a glass of Portuguese red wine and eating Dad’s bolognese. And another in the morning practicing Bach and sipping loose-leaf tea. Am waiting for the impending lull after being high on tea the last couple of days.

41.

Went for curry with Ellis and Missus, Stugger and Carola and quite a few people bailed for various reasons. Carola was very annoying in the restaurant - the same pushy, abrasive atitude that makes her tiring and annoying to work with. She still has to go, or at least be completely marginalised in the project. Independent of what Stugger thinks. Leaving it to November is a cop out, but you can give her a strong signal now so she can’t complain that it’s out of the blue. Also, Stugger will probably be absolutely sick of the sight of her by November.

Went out for meal with folks yesterday to Italian place Colossus.
