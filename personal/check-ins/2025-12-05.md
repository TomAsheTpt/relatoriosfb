**Date:** Friday, December 5, 2025  
**Format:** Combined GTD Review + Weekly Check-in

## The Twatometerâ„¢

**Score: 0.5** âœ…

Sleep-deprived at Tuesday leadership meeting, got a bit sharp with Carol about sÃ­tio trip meeting discipline. Tone issue, not content - she actually does need to tighten up meeting structure, but could have been smoother. Also had odd niggles with Thamires through the week. Nothing major, just tired and human.

**Coffee discipline:** One tea daily, holding strong despite exhaustion.

**Sleep situation:** Thiago 5am wake-ups + stress from firing Camila, captaÃ§Ã£o pressure, BEM news processing. Back to okay sleep heading into weekend.

## Week Executed (Nov 30 - Dec 5)

### Major Wins

**British Empire Medal Confirmed** ðŸ…  
Tuesday Dec 3: British Consul confirmed BEM award. Public announcement Monday Dec 29 at 22:30 UK time (19:30 Rio), published Dec 30. Citation: "For services to Music Education in Rio de Janeiro" (changed from "Underprivileged Children" to remove patronizing tone).

Massive morale boost after heavy few weeks. Can use "Tom Ashe, BEM" on all professional materials from Dec 30 onwards. Strategic for captaÃ§Ã£o credibility - not just "guy running music project" but "officially recognized by UK government for significant work."

**Germany Project Accelerating** ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª  
Bad Kissingen confirmed interest, asking about fees, want core youth bands involved (not just side groups). Discovery: Franconia region (Bavaria) has dense brass band culture - festivals in Bad Kissingen, Coburg Samba Festival, Bamberg, Nuremberg (Baroque Festival or similar).

European strategy crystallizing from vague "maybe somewhere" to concrete region with established infrastructure. Potential revenue stream: paid workshops + performances + building Favela Brass European profile. Yorkshire brass band model but in Bavaria - dense network means once established in one, introductions to others become easier.

**Kaiser Venue Finalized** ðŸ›ï¸  
Tuesday meeting with Natasha sorted rehearsal space logistics PLUS:
- Carnival Saturday program: Brass parade up to Zola, then programming through the day after Carnival
- Percussion storage solution: Spare Kaiser rooms for school instruments over holidays (solves security problem at Brazilian municipal schools)

Kaiser relationship delivering multiple strategic benefits beyond just replacing Centro AssunÃ§Ã£o.

**2026 Budget Session Completed** ðŸ’°  
Session with Raissa established reality: R$1M PRIO (inflation squeeze), no new sponsor money yet, personal salary R$8,400 vs needed R$12-15k, owing mum R$70k+. Today's Wesley conversation (Dec 5) allocates teacher hours and programs within these constraints.

### Completed Tasks

âœ… Germany project outline sent (progressing to fees discussion)  
âœ… "Isn't She Lovely" arrangement completed  
âœ… "O Descobridor dos Sete Mares" 80% done (finishing today Dec 5)  
âœ… First week December comms posts scheduled (Tom + AI laboratory month test working so far)  
âœ… Present for Margo & Judy sorted  
âœ… Second cameraman booked for Copa Palace (Dec 7)  
âœ… Natasha Kaiser meeting completed  
âœ… 2026 budget session with Raissa completed  

### Still Pending

âŒ PRIO 2026 renewal document - Bureaucratic compliance paperwork. Meeting done (R$1M confirmed), but need to submit written proposal/report for internal PRIO compliance. Could use opportunity to make inflation adjustment case, but primarily just box-ticking. No hard deadline but needs doing soon.

### Fires & Operational Pressure

**Forgotten Hedi Pizzeria Show:** Tonight (Friday Dec 5) - had to rush flyer creation. Classic comms pressure symptom now Camila's gone (fired Nov 28).

**Camila Exit Aftermath:** Taking over all comms work yourself in December as "laboratory month" to understand actual time/skill requirements before deciding January hire strategy. Working so far but pressure is real.

---

## Capacity Realities

**Morning Arranging:** Still disrupted. Thiago wakes 5am daily, too active to arrange with baby in arms. Shifted to strategic AI planning walks (this conversation format) for communications, captaÃ§Ã£o thinking, board prep.

**Post-lunch arranging blocks:** When possible, but compressed by parenting + operational demands.

**Evening routine:** Kettlebells + trumpet 7-8pm, hitting ~4/7 sessions. Not perfect but sustainable rhythm maintained.

**Sleep deprivation sources:** Thiago 5am wake-ups + stress (Camila firing, captaÃ§Ã£o uncertainty, BEM processing, Germany opportunity excitement).

---

## Key Insights This Week

**Fires vs. Strategic Work**  
Easy to get pulled into firefighting (forgotten shows, rushed flyers, comms pressure) but real priority next week isn't performances - it's **Wednesday Dec 11 board meeting on statute revisions**.

**Governance Debate Stakes:** Should Executive Director be on the board?  
- **Your position:** NO - proper church/state separation, international best practice, prevents conflict of interest
- **Opposition (Luca + others):** YES - Brazilian NGO model (citing Gerando FalcÃµes, other orgs where founder-director sits on board)

This isn't just procedural - it defines governance structure for years. If you lose this debate, you're locked into board seat that fundamentally changes your role and relationship with organization. Can't wing this one.

**Germany = Real Opportunity**  
Not theoretical "someday Europe" but concrete: specific region, dense brass infrastructure, asking about money, want main bands involved. Could become actual revenue stream (workshops + performances) while building European profile. Needs funding strategy work but legitimately promising.

**Tom + AI Communications Lab Working**  
Week 1 December posts got scheduled. System functioning. Pressure is real but proving you can actually do this in December to understand what to hire for in January.

## Week Ahead Focus (Dec 7-13)

### Anchor Priority: Board Meeting Prep

**Wednesday Dec 11 board meeting** decides statute revisions. Must build case for why ED shouldn't be board member using **Monday/Tuesday morning walks with AI**. Then pre-align with:
- **Luca** (lawyer on governance team, leads opposition) - before Wednesday
- **Marcelo** (board president) - before Wednesday

Cannot lose this debate. Structure matters.

### Events This Week

- **Friday Dec 5 (today):** Hedi pizzeria show tonight
- **Saturday Dec 6:** Margo sÃ­tio trip (TerezÃ³polis) - all day
- **Sunday Dec 7:** Copa Palace gig with PRIO
- **Wednesday Dec 11:** Board meeting + VW corporate gig with Negra Li (Wesley's band)
- **Thursday Dec 12:** Museu da RepÃºblica show (you conducting while Wesley does VW gig)

### Hard Priorities

1. **Brief Dalan for Copa Palace filming** (before Sunday) - what iPhone footage needed for stories/posts
2. **Board meeting prep** (Mon/Tue walks) - build separation of powers argument
3. **Pre-align Luca + Marcelo** (before Wed) - get governance team aligned before meeting
4. **Create MTB exam Portuguese script + train Wesley on app** (aim Tuesday) - exams coming soon
5. **Align with Wesley on Museu show logistics** (before Thursday) - set list, meeting point, timing

### Keep Rolling

- December comms posts continuing (planned in Coda)
- Create Zola performance video for YouTube (can do on bus from TerezÃ³polis Saturday)
- Optimize 10 years documentary on YouTube (chapters, channel highlighting)
- Germany funding strategy thinking (morning walks when not doing board prep)

### Admin Tasks

- Talk to Raissa about December Rouanet PF payment
- Look for tuba case at home for student
- Check with Wesley about school permissions for 2026
- Send 10 years documentary link to Anjoum (BEM context)
- PRIO renewal document (soon-ish)

## Today's Tasks (Friday Dec 5)

**Before SÃ­tio Trip:**
1. Finish "O Descobridor dos Sete Mares" arrangement (80% â†’ 100%)
2. Get supplemental present for Margo & Judy (Thamires says framed photos alone not enough)
3. 2026 structure conversation with Wesley - define lessons, allocate teacher hours, say no to expensive ideas within R$1M constraint

**Tonight:** Hedi pizzeria show

---

## Strategic Context

**PRIO 2026:** R$1M confirmed (75% funding dependency continues). Camilla mentioned "reducing curve" from 2027 onwards to pressure captaÃ§Ã£o, but likely internal politics not actual policy. Inflation squeeze is real though - R$1M in 2026 buys less than R$1M in 2025.

**Germany Opportunity:** Moving from idea to concrete. Bad Kissingen asking about fees means they're budgeting. Franconia brass density means sustainable European presence possible, not one-off. Need funding strategy for Goethe Institut, potential donors.

**BEM Strategic Use:** Once public Dec 29/30, becomes hook for January captaÃ§Ã£o push. Fresh reason to message Julio's network, Margo's IRB contacts, Ed's company list: "Wanted to share exciting news about recognition for Favela Brass's work..."

**Governance Stakes:** Board meeting Wednesday isn't just procedural. Luca (lawyer) will have arguments prepared. You need solid case for separation of powers that goes beyond "international practice says so" - needs to be "here's why it matters for Favela Brass specifically."
