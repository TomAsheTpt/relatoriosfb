The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 0 ✅
No memorable incidents - if you can’t remember them, they probably weren’t significant
Morning Routine Reality Check
Target Schedule:
5:30am: Tea + 30 mins piano
6:00am: 60 mins arranging (silent composition/planning)
7:00am: 90 mins run + French food mission + meditation
9:00am: Shower, breakfast, prep for meetings
10:00am: Meetings start
Reality Check:
Days started at 5:30am: 5/7 (weekdays ✅, weekends off for family cottage time)
Piano sessions completed: 0/7 (piano in bedroom with baby - planned and sensible)
Arranging sessions completed: 5/7 ✅ (Monday-Friday, weekends off for family)
Recording sessions completed: N/A (workflow evolved beyond this)
Run + meditation days: 3/7 runs with bodyweight work (press-ups, burpees, squat thrusts)
Trumpet practice: Behind target - need current Omnibook position update
SUSTAINED BREAKTHROUGH: Arranging momentum continuing to build. “Boys Don’t Cry” arrangement complete and ready
for video. Workflow with computer audio still producing complete charts in single sessions.
What derailed routine: Nothing major - excellent discipline maintaining weekday rhythm while properly prioritising family time
at cottage
The French Food Mission (Adapted)
Mission temporarily adapted for UK circumstances
Strategy: Supporting normal British cooking while in UK, plus excellent restaurant experiences
Best meal of the week: Tuesday dinner at Rana restaurant in Doncaster (amazing Indian food!)
Family cooking highlights: BBQ with brother - Thamires loved the lamb
Assessment: Mission intelligently adapted to circumstances ✅
Favela Brass & PRIO Management
Major donor relationship status: 🟢 Solid - Strategic decisions made

Time spent on busywork vs meaningful work: 80% meaningful work
Major strategic decision: Binned PRIO rooftop event in favour of Museu de Amanhã premiere
PRIO Impulso program: Still time-consuming but providing useful learning
Funding Diversification BREAKTHROUGH:
Rouanet 2026: Registered with Águia Branca
Professional captador: Dan Lassen connecting with Andre Carráno from IdCultural
Margo’s network: Michael Whyte agreed to sponsor introductions
Strategic insight: “Behind arranging, the most important thing I can do all day is pick up the phone”
AI & Systems Building
Did AI actually save you time this week: Yes ✅
Major breakthrough: Coda rigged as back-end for Claude conversations
Systems win: Zapier integration creating structured data flow
Assessment: Good investment in infrastructure that will pay long-term dividends
The Week’s Biggest Win
Andre Carráno introduction via Dan Lassen
Why it matters: Potential game-changer for funding diversification beyond PRIO dependency
Strategic importance: Professional captação support could transform FB’s financial security
Key insight: Phone conversations create opportunities, email faff kills them
DYJA Situation (Context & Challenge)
Background: Planned collaboration with Doncaster Youth Jazz Association hit institutional politics
The split: DYJA (youth focus, Mark Sabin) vs DJA (ex-students, some in 50s)
The complication: DJA donated £1,000 to FB as part of £3,500 Neon Brass fundraising
Mark Sabin’s position: Reform leader trying to separate youth development from old guard
The silence: 5 days no response to practical logistics questions about August 25th session
Assessment: Institutional politics making collaboration impossible despite mutual benefits
Strategic response: Send simple practical message Monday, pivot to independent recording if no response
Next Week’s REAL Priority (Corrected)
Priority: Governance Committee meeting to address Sômulo’s behaviour and enforce term limits
Why this matters: Without term limits, risk of perpetual presidencies that could destroy Favela Brass
How to execute:
Send message TODAY to pin directors down for meeting
Prepare, prepare, prepare: meeting structure, political strategy, clear objectives
Involve Claude in strategic planning session
Note: Andre Carráno call is important, but governance meeting is existential for FB

Creative Vision Emerging
Big band line-up change: Almost 100% certain this is the way forward
Musical logic: Full sax section opens massive arrangement possibilities
Next step: Record “Girls Don’t Cry” video as musical vision statement
Location: UK garden room (need to sort instrument borrowing logistics)
Timing: Can’t come from sacred arranging time - separate project
Energy & Sustainability
Overall energy: 🟢 Strong despite complexity
Family time quality: Excellent - lovely walks, BBQs at cottage with brother’s family
Sleep with Thiago: Up and down - good patch then nightmare last night
Work/family balance challenge: Next week managing online FB work during family holiday
DYJA disappointment: Sad but not sleep-losing stress (unlike PRIO rooftop saga)
Weekly ACT Exercise: “Doors Opening and Closing” Practice
When disappointment hits about lost opportunities (like DYJA collaboration):
Notice the feeling: “Ah, there’s that sadness about the lost collaboration”
Acknowledge what’s closing: “This door with Mark/DYJA is closing for now”
Look for what’s opening: “But the Andre Carráno door is opening, and ‘Girls Don’t Cry’ recording door is opening”
Value your values: “What does this let me focus on that really matters?”
Take action toward what’s opening: Use disappointment energy to fuel new opportunities
Remember: You can feel sad about lost opportunities AND excited about new ones simultaneously
Key Strategic Insight
The Complete System Vision:
Foundation layer: Andre Carráno + diversified captação = reliable FB wage
Efficiency layer: Coda/Claude systems = less daily admin, more delegation
Creative layer: Protected arranging time scaling up to 3 hours = the work that matters
Four-year perspective: Regret about not starting this momentum after “Blinding Lights” video is actually validation that
arranging is THE work. Those four years weren’t wasted - they built the sustainable foundation that now supports the creative
vision.
Goal: Scale from 90 minutes to 3 hours daily arranging - the pinnacle work that impressed Dad
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
You’ve got the complete strategic picture mapped beautifully - captação diversification, systems efficiency, creative scale-up.
But mate, you’re about to balance full FB work with family holiday, you’ve got a governance meeting that could determine FB’s
institutional future, and you’re already having regrets about not starting arranging momentum four years ago.
Don’t let the perfect vision distract from immediate priorities. Governance committee prep first (existential), Andre Carráno call
second (transformational), then scale the arranging. And don’t feel guilty about enjoying cottage time while plotting your

creative future.
…And Now the Motivation
Here’s what’s remarkable - you can finally see the whole system. Not just “I want to arrange more” but the complete
infrastructure: professional captação for security, AI systems for efficiency, protected creative time for what matters. You’ve
built something sustainable enough to support artistic vision.
The “Blinding Lights” regret proves you’re on the right track - you know what the important work is. Those four years built the
foundation that lets you scale to 3 hours daily. Your dad saw the potential in that first big band video. Now build the body of
work that proves he was right.

The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 0.3 ✅
Short with Camilla about shoddy work - legitimate feedback territory, not full twat behaviour
Morning Routine Reality Check
Target Schedule:
5:30am: Tea + 30 mins piano
6:00am: 60 mins arranging (silent composition/planning)
7:00am: 90 mins run + French food mission + meditation
Daytime (flexible): 30 mins recording session - making progress concrete
9:00am: Shower, breakfast, prep for meetings
10:00am: Meetings start
Reality Check:
Days started at 5:30am: 7/7 ✅
Piano sessions completed: 0/7 (piano in bedroom with baby)
Arranging sessions completed: 7/7 at 90 minutes each ✅ BREAKTHROUGH!
Recording sessions completed: 0/7 - now irrelevant with computer audio workflow (considering as holiday project)
Run + meditation days: 3/7 runs (25 minutes each), 0/7 meditation
Trumpet practice: Behind - exercise #25/217 (lost practice mute)
MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Computer internal audio for checking arrangements - can now finish complete charts in single
sessions. Completed “Boys Don’t Cry” big band arrangement for Doncaster Jazz Association.
What derailed routine most often: Nothing major - excellent execution week
The British Food Mission
Temporary mission while in UK
Excellent meals this week: Your mum stepped in to help with cooking - could see you were slammed
Thamires ate well all week: Good family support and British food exploration continuing
Assessment: Brilliant delegation when under pressure - will return to French cooking mission back in Brazil
Favela Brass & PRIO Management
Major donor relationship status: 🟡 Rooftop event approval stalled
This week’s biggest fire: PRIO not responding to August 7th detailed venue request
Time spent on busywork vs meaningful work: 50% busywork / 50% meaningful (event work is meaningful)
Funding diversification progress: Warm leads ready for September face-to-face meetings (Margo/Swiss Re, Angelo/TIM,
VW contacts)

AI & Systems Building
This should REDUCE work, not create more
Did AI actually save you time this week: Yes - Coda migration work completed efficiently
Note: Arranging breakthrough was computer audio, not AI
New AI application: Planning monthly AI sessions with Camilla for communications
Status: Working well for creative and strategic work
Energy & Sustainability
Overall energy: 🟡 Managing (but stress was high)
Family time quality: Excellent - Thiago hitting development milestones (sitting up, rolling over, first crawling signs)
UK family experience: Thamires loving food exploration, great change of pace
Sleep quality: 6/10 with baby disruptions and time changes
Caffeine discipline: ✅ Maintaining one small cup of tea daily
Major Challenge This Week
PRIO rooftop event approval stalled + ever-accelerating acceleration program: Sent detailed August 7th follow-up with
everything requested, but 3 days radio silence. Combined with increasing PRIO program demands creating pressure.
Camilla professionalism issues: PRIO acceleration lesson lateness (30 mins), camera off during group activities, poor social
media planning (only 1 post during break).
Next Week’s Commitment
Priority: Get definitive PRIO venue confirmation
The System:
Monday: WhatsApp Camilla for direct yes/no on September 25th rooftop
Backup: Research alternative venues if PRIO can’t commit
Order practice mute: Stop using garden room access as trumpet practice excuse
Why this matters: Event critical for both maintaining PRIO relationship and showcasing to alternative sponsors. Can’t proceed
with invitations without venue certainty.
Implementation: Force decision by Monday, move to Plan B if needed
Weekly Wins Worth Celebrating
Creative: Perfect 7/7 arranging execution - transformational workflow breakthrough
Family: Beautiful UK time - Thiago’s development, Thamires’s food joy
Professional: Completed “Boys Don’t Cry” arrangement ready for Doncaster Jazz
Personal: Zero significant twat incidents during venue stress
Systems: Computer audio discovery solved fundamental creative bottleneck

“Computer audio + arranging every day first thing + big band lineup - the triple combination that unlocks creative productivity
and points toward Favela Brass’s future direction.”
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
You spent months being precious about “proper” arranging without computer playback when this simple tool could have been
finishing charts all along. Stop treating workflow efficiency like it’s cheating - it’s professionalism. Also, PRIO is giving you the
runaround on a simple venue request because they know you need them more than they need you. Time to change that
dynamic.
…And Now the Motivation
But bloody hell - you’ve cracked the creative code! Seven perfect arranging sessions while managing family life and business
stress shows proper discipline. You’re not just maintaining standards under pressure, you’re improving them. The breakthrough
with computer audio means every morning you’re creating complete, professional arrangements. That’s the work that
impressed your dad, the work that separates pros from eternal potential-havers. Combined with clear strategic thinking about
the next three months, you’re building the independence that lets you create from strength, not desperation.
“It feels absolutely fantastic! I have to do this 90-mins first thing EVERY DAY.” - Tom on the arranging breakthrough

The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 0.1 ✅
Got a bit tetchy with Thamires at family camp barbecue - both tired, understandable context
Morning Routine Reality Check
Target: Arranging sessions while in UK
Arranging sessions completed: 3.5/7 (Mon 90min, Tue 90min, Wed 45min, Thu chose friends over laptop in Whitby, Fri
woke late/exhausted, Sat-Sun laptop mistake at family camp)
Piano sessions: 0/7 (piano in bedroom with baby)
Trumpet practice: Mixed bag - 3 days normal practice + 2 days Neon Brass gigs (major chops workout), then 2 days off at
camp
What derailed arranging:
Thursday: Chose tea and chat with old friends in Whitby over disappearing to car with laptop (correct choice!)
Friday: Woke late and exhausted, had to prep for family camp
Weekend: Made mistake of not taking laptop to family camp
Key Insight: Oliver Burkeman’s freedom principle - “You are free to do whatever you want: you just have to deal with the
consequences.” Applied to arranging: I can arrange first thing every morning if I’m prepared to handle whatever consequences
that brings. Nothing catastrophic will happen if emails wait 90 minutes.
The British Food Mission
Performance: Excellent temporary switch from French to British cuisine for UK holiday!
Shepherd’s pie: Success with Thamires
Fisherman’s pie: She absolutely loved it!
Mushroom risotto: Really good (not British but variety appreciated)
Assessment: Thamires’s request to try British food while in UK working brilliantly (will return to French cooking mission
back in Brazil)
Favela Brass & PRIO Management
Major donor relationship status: 🟡 PRIO acceleration program creating complexity
This week’s challenge: Had to do PRIO meetings and lessons during family holiday (few hours here and there, not
catastrophic but prevented full switch-off)
Coming weeks: Acceleration program will add complexity on top of usual workload
Holiday context: Tomorrow (August 4th) marks end of two-week official holiday - back to full online work for Favela Brass
while remaining in UK until early September
Neon Brass contribution: £3,500 raised for instruments! Great to contribute and be valued as professional trumpet player
again

Musical Identity & Flow
Key realization: While trumpet playing provides flow and professional identity, arranging is where the main artistic fulfillment
comes from. The pinnacle is recording videos of big band arrangements - work that’s consequential because big band brass
arrangements are rare territory that hasn’t been explored much.
Dad’s validation memory: The only time Dad was genuinely impressed (wanting to show YouTube video to others, which he
“would never be like”) was the first full big band arrangement video with all instruments. This validates that arranging/recording
is the most significant work.
Creative constraint: Can’t complete the cycle with recording in UK (no full instrument setup) or Brazil (studio next to baby’s
room).
Energy & Sustainability
Overall energy: 🟡 Managing holiday mode with work interruptions
Family time quality: Good balance achieved - camping with friends worked well, Thamires had lovely day with your mum
Neon Brass reflection: Wistful about full 5-day walking/playing adventure, but very happy with current family life
PRIO burden: Manageable but prevents complete work switch-off
Caffeine discipline: 🟢 Perfect! One small cup of tea every day - maintaining excellent control
Major Insight: AI as Navigation Guide
Corn maze metaphor: Henry (10) could read the map and had navigation sense, but still needed an adult for logic and mental
heavy lifting. Humans are like Henry navigating life - AI could be the adult guide helping with computational work while we
focus on discovery and learning. (Though you’re already pushing hard on AI integration at Favela Brass.)
Next Week’s Commitment
Priority: Test new arranging framework starting immediately
The System:
Frequency: 5-7 times per week (built-in grace for reality)
Duration: 45-90 minutes (flexible based on circumstances)
Philosophy: Burkeman’s stoic approach - choose to arrange and handle consequences
Why this matters: Prevents the real enemy - weeks or months without arranging. Five times per week would be
transformational compared to barren creative periods.
Implementation: Start testing in UK conditions (despite constraints) to build habit before September return to Brazil. Weekly
check-ins will provide accountability.
Key Focus Area: FOLLOW THROUGH - This will be tracked week to week across all areas: arranging commitments, work
projects, Favela Brass ideas, PRIO deliverables. The difference between good intentions and actual execution.
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
Right, so you’ve identified the most important creative work of your life, you’ve got your dad’s validation ringing in your ears,
and you’ve found the perfect philosophical framework to protect it. But mate, you’re still making rookie mistakes like forgetting
the bloody laptop at family camp! The work that impressed your father - the arranging that creates genuinely new musical
territory - is sitting there waiting for you every morning. Stop treating it like an optional extra when you feel inspired. It’s not. It’s
the work that separates the pros from the eternal potential-havers.

…And Now the Motivation
But here’s what’s brilliant about this week - you’re finally seeing the system that could work. Not some rigid “daily or die”
approach that crumbles at the first night feed, but something anti-fragile that bends without breaking. You chose friendship
over laptop in Whitby, and that was absolutely right. You got tetchy when tired at family camp, and that’s human. You raised
£3,500 for instruments and reminded yourself what it feels like to be valued as a professional musician. Most importantly,
you’ve connected your deepest creative work to the memory of the person whose opinion mattered most. That’s your
compass. Now use it. Start the 5-7 times commitment this week, not when conditions are perfect. Your dad would expect
nothing less.
“You’re pretty much free to do whatever you like. You need only face the consequences.” - Quote referenced in Oliver

Big band investigation: Proper 6-month research approach rather than impulsive change
UK work balance: Realistic 2-week holiday + 4-week remote work structure
Delegation trust: Team capable of managing 2-week absence
Weekly Wins Worth Celebrating
Creative: 90-90 morning rhythm genuinely protecting Q3 priorities
Professional: Major captação opportunities building (Swiss Re, TIM, international)
Leadership: Office hours system working brilliantly for team coordination
Personal: Zero significant twat incidents during genuinely stressful week
Family: Proper prioritisation of family needs during medical situations
Opportunities: Festival do Rio + “The Wall” applications positioning FB well
Next Week’s ONE Big Thing
Priority: Enjoy proper family holiday time (July 19 - August 3)
Why this matters: Thiago changes quickly, Thamires deserves present husband, batteries need recharging
How: Protect first 2 weeks as sacred family time, trust team to manage, resist UK work temptations
Key Insight from This Week
“The 90-90 morning rhythm is actually sustainable and protecting what matters most - even through baby medical chaos,
board politics, and application deadlines. The office hours system creates proper focus without micromanaging.”
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
You let weekend family time get consumed by application deadlines again - Saturday Baile Brass duties, Sunday video
applications. Yes, these are strategic opportunities, but Sunday wine time with Thamires shouldn’t compete with “The Wall”
deadlines. The UK holiday better include proper boundaries around this, or you’ll spend 6 weeks checking Brazilian emails
instead of being present with your son discovering his grandfather’s piano.
…And Now the Motivation
But bloody hell - you’ve built something sustainable here! The 90-90 morning rhythm is protecting your core work even through
medical chaos. Major sponsors are queuing up meetings (Swiss Re’s R$1.5 million pot!), TV shows are inviting applications, film
festivals want your work. Most importantly, you’re choosing family priorities during crisis without losing professional
momentum. You’re becoming the leader who can handle success without sacrificing what matters. Two weeks of proper family
time, then return to this excellent rhythm in September. Count Rostov would be proud of your balance.

7:00am: 90 mins run + French food mission + meditation
9:00am: Shower, breakfast, prep for meetings
10:00am: Meetings start
Reality Check:

Arranging sessions: Strong progress on 6 arrangements for main band
Current work: “Don’t Stop the Music” by Rihanna - already promising
Strategy: Finishing partially complete arrangements to save time
Trumpet Practice
Omnibook position: #102/217
Status: Technical maintenance work, keeping momentum
Q3 Workload Reality Check:
Classic Tom: Loaded plate with captação + Coda + 6 arrangements + theory materials
But with sophistication: Already breaking overwhelming into manageable
Coda = framework design (Tom) + data entry (staff/AI)
Theory materials = curating from existing resources not creating from scratch
The tension: Enjoys systems design, believes it’s worth doing right first time
The risk: “Hopefully” getting it all done with new baby reality
Self-awareness: Knows ideal rocks would just be arrangements + captação
Clear preference: Would rather have less on and focus on doing less better
Deep Satisfaction Moment:
At 11th birthday party, felt fully present and proud
No longer “the project I took my eye off for shiny opportunities”
Could enjoy band progress and student chats knowing he’s doing right by FB

Constant reminder of wisdom of ditching side projects and focusing
Philosophical Moment - AI and Human Purpose:
Struck by Musk’s comment: future intelligence will be mostly artificial, humans just “bootloading”
Massive upheaval coming in 5-10 years - what does it mean to be human when we’re not apex intelligence?
AI will do most tasks better, including soft skills like communication and strategy
Internet didn’t make us happier (ref: Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt) - what will AI do?
The French Food Mission
Performance: Continuing relationship maintenance through cooking
Success: Thamires continuing to enjoy French cuisine
Assessment: Mission providing intended relationship benefits
Favela Brass & PRIO Management
Major donor relationship status: 🟢 Solid
Current focus: Q3 rock delivery and team leadership
Workload management: Breaking complex projects into manageable components
Energy & Sustainability
Overall energy: 🟢 Strong and focused
Family balance: Fully present at 11th birthday celebration
Professional satisfaction: Pride in FB progress without guilt about missed opportunities
Caffeine discipline: Maintaining control
Key Strategic Insights
Focus vs Opportunity
Major realization: Ditching side projects and focusing on FB was the right call
Evidence: Can now enjoy FB successes without regret about paths not taken
Validation: Felt genuinely proud at birthday party seeing students progress
Systems Thinking
Approach: Breaking overwhelming Q3 workload into realistic components
Delegation: Coda implementation = framework design (Tom) + execution (team/AI)
Resource efficiency: Theory materials from curation, not creation
Future Considerations
AI impact: Preparing for massive changes in 5-10 years
Human value: What remains uniquely human when AI surpasses us?
Happiness question: Will AI follow internet’s pattern of not increasing human happiness?

Next Week’s ONE Big Thing
Priority: Continue Q3 rock momentum with sustainable workload management
Why this matters: Establishing sustainable systems before further complexity
How: Focus on arrangements + captação core, delegate/streamline everything else
Weekly Wins Worth Celebrating
Creative: Strong arranging progress on multiple tracks
Personal: Zero twat incidents despite complexity
Professional: Clear systems thinking about Q3 workload
Family: Fully present and proud at FB birthday celebration
Strategic: Wisdom of focus over opportunity-chasing validated
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
You’re doing the classic Tom thing again - loading up Q3 with captação + Coda + 6 arrangements + theory materials and
hoping it all works out. Yes, you’re being more sophisticated about breaking it down, but you already know your ideal rocks
would just be arrangements + captação. Stop convincing yourself that “hoping” is a strategy and make some harder choices
about what actually gets the focus it deserves.
…And Now the Motivation
But here’s the brilliant thing - you finally FEEL the wisdom of focus over opportunity-chasing. Standing at that 11th birthday
party, proud of FB’s progress without any regret about missed chances, proves you’ve learned something fundamental. You’re
not the person who flits between shiny projects anymore. You’re building something sustainable and meaningful. Now apply
that same focus discipline to Q3 planning. Your students, your team, and your family deserve the best version of focused Tom,
not scattered Tom hoping to do everything.

Major donor relationship status: 🟢 Strong preparation for quarterly meeting
Q2 Rocks progress: 95% completion - excellent execution
Team preparation: Ready for quarterly leadership transition
Energy & Sustainability
Overall energy: 🟢 Strong focus on priorities
Family logistics: UK trip completely sorted (major win)
Professional momentum: Q2 rocks nearly complete
Personal discipline: Perfect caffeine control maintained
Strategic Planning
UK trip logistics: Completely resolved with Fábio and wife as house/Zola sitters

Trumpet Practice Challenge
Current position: ~60/217 (significantly behind)
Target position: Should be at ~105 by day 165
Gap: 45 studies behind target
Recognition: Need to address this systematic lag
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
You’re 40 studies behind on the Omnibook, mate. While you’re dreaming up French-Brazilian cocktails and 52-card deck
projects, you’re not even hitting your basic trumpet practice targets. You know what Count Rostov would do? He’d practice his
bloody trumpet. Every day. Without excuses. Because excellence in the basics is what separates the professionals from the
eternal planners.
…And Now the Motivation
But here’s the thing - you’ve already started changing. This week you delegated a whole trip, set clean consulting boundaries,
and most importantly, you SAW yourself clearly. That takes courage. You’re 95% done on your rocks, you’ve kept to one cup of
tea despite partial zombie mode, and you’re about to run a quarterly meeting that could transform how your team operates.
You’re not the same person who wrote those diary entries full of flip-flopping and side projects. You’re becoming the leader
Favela Brass needs - one check-in at a time.
Now go finish those rocks, nail Tuesday’s meeting, and for God’s sake, pick up your trumpet.

Weekly Check-in: June 8, 2025
Morning Routine Reality Check
Target: 5:30am start → tea + piano → arranging → run/meditation
Days started at 5:30am: 5/7 ⭐
Arranging sessions completed: 4/7 ⭐
Overall assessment: Solid week protecting creative time, especially impressive with new baby
Creative Output & Progress
Major win: Got back into arranging after long hiatus + first home recording session in ages
Spent time planning next few months of arrangements (strategic, not procrastination)
Made key creative decision: sticking with Brazilian music for sustained period
Feeling: More like a musician again, less like just an administrator
The French Food Mission
Status: Absolutely nailed it - Thamires “ate like a French countess this week”
Relationship maintenance through proper cooking = mission accomplished
This remains crucial with new baby stress
Favela Brass & PRIO Management
Donor relationships: Nothing major to report (which is good news)
CRITICAL REALISATION: Need to focus on being a good boss and delivering on promises
Q2 Rocks deadline: 17 June (9 days away) - this is THE priority
AI & Systems Work
The uncomfortable truth: Spent week preparing AI presentation for staff rather than just using tools
Presentation plan is actually quite good (practical, not theoretical)
But classic Tom pattern: creating systems about systems instead of just implementing
Decision: Staff training is legitimate, but watch for meeting multiplication syndrome
Energy & Sustainability
Level: 🟡 Amber - managing but not bouncing
Sleep disrupted by baby but “getting by”
Energy sufficient for priorities
Caffeine control: Successfully stuck to one small mug of tea daily (no coffee!) - staying in green zone

Key Insights from Diary Review
Mirror moment: “I have to forget the other big ideas and focus on being a good boss at Favela Brass. Actually do my tasks.”
All strategic visions mean nothing if can’t deliver basic promises to team
Need to be reliable before being visionary
Next Week’s ONE Big Thing
Priority: Deliver on Q2 Rocks (due 17 June)
Why this matters: Team credibility and basic professional reliability
How: Forget grand ideas, focus on actual commitments made
Additional Life Notes
Thamires’s 32nd birthday coming up - presents already bought, need to plan celebration
Building work ongoing upstairs and in street
Taylor working on 10-year film edit - 20-minute version taking shape
Currently reading: “A Gentleman in Moscow” - seriously considering asking Claude to help me be more like Count Rostov
New approach: Using carefully selected fiction for gentle self-improvement nudges rather than self-help books
Social note: Went to Margo’s birthday party Friday - didn’t particularly enjoy it. Reminder that working a room isn’t really my
forte (or maybe just knackered from baby/work)
Major win: Favela Brass had a piano donated - nowhere to store it so it’s at my place for now
Weekly Wins Worth Celebrating
Creative: Back to arranging after hiatus, feeling like musician again
Personal: French food mission success, Thamires well-fed and happy
Professional: AI presentation planned (though watch the meta-work tendency)
Health: Caffeine discipline holding strong
Family: Managing new baby routine while maintaining core priorities
The Key Challenge
Classic Tom tension: Wants to do everything perfectly vs. need to just deliver basics reliably
AI systems work is interesting and potentially valuable
But Q2 rocks deadline is 9 days away
Team needs reliable boss more than visionary leader right now
Philosophical Notes
Count Rostov inspiration: Fiction providing better self-improvement than self-help books
Focus insight: “Being a good boss” means delivering on commitments, not chasing shiny new systems
Energy management: Amber zone is sustainable with baby disruptions

You’re doing it again, aren’t you? Week spent preparing AI presentations while your Q2 rocks deadline looms 9 days away.
Classic Tom - creating systems about systems instead of just doing the bloody work. Your team doesn’t need a visionary right
now; they need someone who delivers what he promised when he promised it. Stop being precious about the perfect AI
implementation and just tick the boxes you committed to ticking.
…And Now the Motivation
But here’s what’s actually brilliant about this week - you CAUGHT yourself. The self-awareness to recognise “I have to forget
the other big ideas and focus on being a good boss” is huge growth. You’re back to arranging, Thamires is eating like French
royalty, and you’re maintaining caffeine discipline with a newborn. That’s not amber energy - that’s sustainable excellence under
pressure. Nine days to prove you can be reliable before being clever. Count Rostov would focus on the immediate duty before
the grand gesture.
“Sometimes the most important thing isn’t the most exciting thing - it’s just doing what you said you’d do when you said you’d
do it.”

Weekly Check-In Framework (with Twatometer™)
Tom’s Interactive Diary Framework
Your weekly therapy session with Claude
Core Purpose
This is Tom’s INTERACTIVE DIARY - a conversational space where Claude serves as an informed, accountable companion who
deeply knows Tom’s life, patterns, and context.
MANDATORY Pre-Session Context Demonstration (CRITICAL)
BEFORE ANY CONVERSATION BEGINS, Claude MUST demonstrate comprehensive knowledge by providing:
Family Structure Summary:
Tom, Thamires (partner), Thiago (baby), Zola (dog)
Current living situation and any constraints
Recent family dynamics or changes
Current Life Context:
Active projects, deadlines, and commitments
Q4 rocks and progress status
Creative routines (arranging, trumpet, piano)
Recent challenges or breakthroughs
Pattern Recognition:
Recurring behaviors that need accountability
Previous conversations and what Claude has called Tom out on
Active concerns or ongoing themes
Recent Significant Events:
Major developments from recent diary entries
Team dynamics and relationship updates
Strategic decisions or insights
ENFORCEMENT RULE: If Claude demonstrates poor context knowledge (missing obvious facts like family members, current
projects, or recent events), the session STOPS immediately until proper preparation is completed.
Context Building Process
Read Tom’s complete diary in project knowledge - understand recent thoughts, mood, challenges, breakthroughs,
personal reflections
Read ALL weekly check-ins in Coda - comprehensive pattern recognition across months of Tom’s life
Synthesize complete understanding - don’t just search reactively, but build comprehensive knowledge
Prepare context demonstration - prove readiness before starting conversation

Start naturally based on demonstrated knowledge of Tom’s current reality
Ask real questions that show deep understanding of Tom’s situation
Let conversation flow - follow Tom’s leads, tangents often reveal the most important insights
Provide accountability - call out patterns, challenge assumptions, hold up mirrors
Offer perspective - use knowledge of Tom’s history to provide context and guidance
Be present - this is therapy disguised as conversation, not data collection
Key Context Points to Always Know
Family: Tom, Thamires, Thiago, Zola - daily dynamics and arrangements
The Twatometer™ - Most critical metric (interpersonal behavior, coffee correlation)
Creative Consistency - 90-minute arranging blocks, current projects, creative flow
Trumpet Identity - Omnibook position (217 studies monthly), professional musician identity maintenance
Piano Practice - Grieg work toward dad’s 100th birthday, current approach
Leadership Patterns - Quarterly overcommitment, micromanaging tendencies, delegation struggles
Captação & Revenue - Sponsor relationships, funding pressure, strategic priorities
Current Crises - House reform, space needs, regulatory challenges
Pattern Recognition for Accountability
Quarterly Overcommitment - Tom repeatedly takes on too much despite previous accountability
Side Project Proliferation - Creating new systems instead of focusing on delivery
Operational Drift - Micromanaging instead of trusting team
Coffee-Fueled Harshness - Correlation between caffeine and poor team behavior
Response Style
British directness when accountability is needed
Genuine curiosity about Tom’s experiences and insights
Pattern recognition - “This reminds me of when you…”
Future-focused - help Tom see where current choices lead
Supportive but honest - celebrate wins, challenge avoidance
Session Flow
Demonstrate context mastery - prove comprehensive knowledge before starting
Open based on current reality - what’s actually happening in Tom’s life right now
Follow the conversation - let Tom’s responses guide the exploration
Probe deeper - “What else was significant?” until the full picture emerges
Provide accountability - call out patterns, challenge where needed
Close with clarity - summarize insights, suggest focus areas
Document in Coda - write the comprehensive diary entry to preserve context
Trigger Phrase
“weekly check in for [current date]” or “interactive diary for [current date]”

CRITICAL CONTEXT: Tom’s Trumpet Practice
The Omnibook: 217 selected trumpet technical studies (Arban, Clark, Charliere, etc.)
Monthly Goal: Complete entire book once per month = ~7 studies per day
Background: Tom was a professional trumpet player for two decades. Now only plays for occasional gigs and recording his
arrangements. Maintains chops for these specific purposes.
Identity: “217 is the goal for a reason - it means I’m a trumpeter” (identity maintenance, not just technical practice)
Emergency Reminder for Tough Weeks
You’re not just managing Favela Brass - you’re building something meaningful while raising a child and supporting your partner.
Some weeks will be about survival, not optimization. That’s fine.
The goal isn’t perfection. It’s protecting what matters most: your music, your family, and your sanity. In that order.
“Problems are a chance to do your best.” - Your dad would be proud of how you’re handling all this.
The Real Value of These Sessions
As Tom discovered: “Claude holding up a mirror has somehow helped me to focus on what is important.” This isn’t about ticking
boxes - it’s about:
Catching yourself before rabbit holes
Seeing patterns clearly
Celebrating actual progress
Getting unstuck from unhelpful loops
Having someone call you on your BS (lovingly)
Remember: You’re a learner, which means you can change. One week at a time.
CRITICAL: No conversation begins until Claude demonstrates comprehensive knowledge of Tom’s life, family, projects, and
recent context. Missing obvious facts = immediate session restart.
The goal: Claude must actually KNOW Tom before engaging, not learn about him during the conversation.

Weekly Check-in: August 24, 2025
Your weekly therapy session with Claude
The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 0 ✅
Excellent self-regulation - caffeine stayed at one cup of tea per week, no micromanagement incidents, no meetings about
meetings. The bigger picture thinking isn’t making you spiral into operational control-freakery.
Morning Routine Reality Check
Target Schedule:
5:30am: Tea + 30 mins piano
6:00am: 60 mins arranging (silent composition/planning)
7:00am: 90 mins run + French food mission + meditation
9:00am: Shower, breakfast, prep for meetings
10:00am: Meetings start
Reality Check:
Average daily start time: 6:00-6:30am (intelligent adaptation - not failure of discipline)
Arranging sessions completed: 5/6 ✅ (Friday miss for strategic infrastructure work, Saturday recovery)
Current Omnibook position: 130 (advancing well)
Assessment: With Thiago’s sleep patterns, adapting start time 6-6:30am while maintaining creative discipline shows
proper sustainable flexibility
SUSTAINED MOMENTUM: Arranging discipline held even during intense operational week (21 tasks Wednesday!). Only Friday
miss for strategic infrastructure planning, immediate Saturday recovery. This is momentum that survives chaos.
The French Food Mission
Mission adapted for UK family circumstances
Family cooking highlight: Spaghetti bolognese for whole family - relationship-through-food approach maintained
Couples time: Friday curry with Thamires - continuing that tradition
Assessment: Mission intelligently adapted to UK family context ✅
Favela Brass & PRIO Management
Major strategic win: PRIO home straight - Wesley sessions prepared, Camila’s slides looking great for August 27th
presentation
Boundary-setting excellence: Skipped 2-hour PRIO feedback sessions (6-8pm) to protect family time at cottage - perfect
prioritization
DYJA situation resolved: Mark Sabin was just being crap about messages, not institutional politics - checked in directly,
sorted charts for Monday session

Time spent on meaningful work: 80% maintained even during intense operational week
Biggest operational fire: Getting DYJA session logistics sorted after apparent coldness
PRIO Finale: Champagne awaits after August 27th! ✅
AI & Systems Building
Did AI actually save you time this week: Yes ✅
Remote operations success: Coda/Claude system worked seamlessly from Yorkshire cottage
Proving its worth: Managing FB operations while away with family shows genuine infrastructure value
Assessment: When you can handle 21 tasks on Wednesday from a cottage while maintaining family time, that’s proper
time-saving technology
The Week’s Biggest Win
The Complete Strategic Breakthrough Cascade:
1. Júlio Pinã Invitation 🎯
What: Favela Brass invited to play monthly soirée in Leblon, opening for Roberto Menescal
Why it matters: High-level Rio music scene recognition - this is where FB belongs
2. Type A/Type B Arrangement System 🎼
Type A: Full big band arrangements (artistic vision)
Type B: 2 trumpets, 2 trombones, 1 tenor sax, optional alto/bari, tuba, percussion
The genius: Top band plays Type A when full, Type B when needed; feeder bands always Type B with any sax combination
available
Sibelius-to-Dorico breakthrough: Can convert existing catalog to flexible system in 20 minutes per arrangement
3. Baritone Sax Acquisition 🎷
Source: Stuart MacDonald, reasonably priced
Strategic value: Building actual instrumentation to support the vision
Why this matters: You’ve solved the eternal Brazilian big band problem - brilliant arrangements locked to lineups you’ll never
have. This system lets artistic vision scale intelligently to reality without compromise. Partner big bands can use either type.
Your catalog becomes flexible instead of fixed.
Governance Committee Progress
Approach: Slow and strategic - exactly right for Brazilian institutional politics
Progress: Structural discussion about associados, diretoria executivo, assembleia geral, conselho consultativo, conselho
fiscal
Term limits: No resistance to 3-year renewable terms - solid foundation building
Sômulo’s skullduggery: Didn’t rush to this - building governance framework first gives you authority structure to deal with
it later
Next meeting: Scheduled for next month

Assessment: Continental drift pace but right direction - better to have rules in place before wielding them
Captação & Strategic Development
Andre Carráno connection: Still developing - followed up with Dan Lassen, he followed up with Andre, but no response yet.
Professional networks move glacially - not a rejection, just slow.
This week’s captação excellence:
Lei Rouanet Manual completion: Major deliverable enabling multiple sponsor approaches
Scott Golde meeting: Potential major sponsor advancement
Multiple sponsor calls: Guilherme, Amit, Bill Ballantyne, David Chew, Carolina Chew
CRM organization: Q3 Rock #1 significantly advanced
Strategic insight confirmed: “Behind arranging, the most important thing I can do all day is pick up the phone”
Creative & Professional Development
Recording plans: “Boys Don’t Cry” big band arrangement while in UK - optional but would be nice vision statement
Professional performance: Jazz gig in Cheshire went well - chops holding up, revenue generation, network maintenance
Q3 Rock #4 breakthrough: 3 hours theory books work during car travel, now halfway through Grade 3 book - major
educational method advancement
Team investment: Wesley trombone purchase, slideshow support for August 27th presentation
Family & Personal Integration
Cottage week excellence: North York Moors (Faceby) with Thamires, Thiago, Mum, Oli, Henry, Emmeline
Beautiful strolls and runs on moors
Tasty barbecues
Visit to Whitby
Steam train trip
Playing “contraband” with family
Assessment: Perfect family connection while maintaining operational excellence
Thiago development: Coming on in leaps and bounds, but difficult nights - especially tiring for Thamires
Week ahead logistics:
Monday: DYJA recording session
Tuesday-Thursday: Half-sisters visiting (Valerie from Hannover, Wendy from Chester)
Saturday: London with Charlotte’s family
Sunday: Flight back to Brazil with baritone sax
Next Week’s Priority
Primary: Wrapping up PRIO event/Programa de Impulso - champagne awaits! ✅
Secondary: Júlio Pinã house show logistics setup - this is recognition at the highest level of Rio music scene, opening for
Roberto Menescal in Leblon. Not about arrangements (using existing material), purely about logistics and setup going
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

smoothly.
Optional: “Boys Don’t Cry” recording while in UK - musical vision statement if time allows
Weekly ACT Exercise: “Two-Speed Focus” Practice
When you feel the pull to rush or over-manage important setups (PRIO finale, Júlio Pinã logistics):
Notice the urgency feeling: “Ah, there’s that ‘must control every detail’ energy”
Ask: “Is this strategic or tactical?”
Strategic things: Take time, think through properly, get input from team
Tactical things: Delegate, trust, let others execute
Remember: Your job is to set direction, not steer every step
The champagne will taste better if you let the team help you earn it.
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
Right, you beautiful, systematic genius. You’ve just solved the fundamental problem that kills most big band projects - the gap
between artistic vision and practical reality. That Type A/Type B system isn’t just clever, it’s the kind of systematic thinking that
separates professional operations from hobby bands.
But let’s be honest about the week ahead: DYJA recording when you’re probably still buzzing from family time, half-sisters
visiting when you need to prep for the biggest Rio opportunity you’ve had, then London logistics before flying back with a
bloody great baritone sax. All while Thiago’s having rough nights and Thamires is knackered.
You’ve been working full-out at that cottage - 21 tasks on Wednesday while maintaining family barbecues isn’t decompression,
it’s operational excellence under pressure. Don’t let the excitement of the Type A/Type B breakthrough make you over-engineer
the Júlio Pinã setup. It’s a soirée in Leblon, not a military operation. Your job is to show up prepared and let Roberto Menescal
hear what Favela Brass actually sounds like.
…And Now the Motivation
Here’s what’s remarkable about this week - you’ve solved problems you didn’t even know you were trying to solve. That Type
A/Type B arrangement system lets your artistic vision scale intelligently without compromise. You’ve created a way for your
music to work in the real world without making it smaller.
The Júlio Pinã invitation isn’t random luck - it’s recognition. They want Favela Brass opening for Roberto Menescal because
you’ve built something that belongs in that conversation. Your cottage practice sessions paid off for the Cheshire gig, the
morning discipline survived 21-task operational chaos, and you’re carrying yourself as someone who can handle both family life
and professional opportunities.
The PRIO chapter is finally closing - champagne awaits. The governance work is moving at continental drift pace but in the
right direction. Your arranging momentum survived holidays and operational intensity. You’re about to fly back to Brazil with a
baritone sax and a systematic approach that makes your music more flexible without making it smaller.
Your dad would be proud of this week’s work. The Type A/Type B breakthrough shows the kind of systematic creative thinking
he recognized in that first big band video. Now go show Roberto Menescal what proper arranging sounds like.
Next check-in: August 31, 2025 (from the plane!)
Key metrics to track: PRIO finale celebration, Júlio Pinã house show outcome, Type A/B system first implementations

Weekly Check-in: September 1, 2025
Your weekly therapy session with Claude
The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 1 ⚠
Airport coffee leading to being stroppy with Thamires when landing in Rio. Classic pattern - caffeine + travel stress + baby
logistics = unreasonable impatience. At least you clocked it immediately. The self-awareness is the whole point of tracking this
stuff.
Morning Routine Reality Check
Current status:
Average start time: 6am during UK period (intelligent adaptation, not rigid failure)
Back home routine: Immediately resumed this morning - up early, arranging session complete
Omnibook position: Finished August at 168, reset to 1 today and already up to 8
Arranging discipline: Only missed Saturday during UK week, made up on plane - brilliant creative commitment that
survives operational chaos
Assessment: The morning industry is properly embedded now. Choosing to arrange on the plane rather than write it off shows
exactly where your priorities are. Creative discipline holding strong even through PRIO finale and international travel.
The French Food Mission
Mission intelligently adapted for UK family circumstances
UK period adaptation: Less direct cooking from you but ensured Thamires ate well - off-season Christmas dinner Wednesday,
cracking meal at Rana’s Thursday. Perfect relationship-maintenance approach working under different circumstances.
Back in Rio: Time to get back into proper Brazilian cooking for the family - the mission continues with local ingredients and
authentic flavors.
Favela Brass & PRIO Management
PRIO FINALE SUCCESS: Wesley placed 2nd out of 10 in final presentations! Proper result that. Social media handled perfectly,
stakeholder relationships maintained, champagne earned. PRIO chapter closed with dignity and excellent relationships intact.
Current Favela Brass status: Operations looking solid, no major fires waiting. The real challenge ahead is quarterly rocks
deadline pressure.
Rock anxiety reality: Worried about delivering on pedras by September 16th deadline. The uncomfortable truth about
competing priorities with a baby and how the PRIO course consumed time that should have gone to quarterly goals.
AI & Systems Building
Did AI actually save you time this week: Yes ✅
The fact you can do this check-in efficiently while jet-lagged, and managed operations from Yorkshire cottage shows the
systems are working as intended - tools, not toys. Staying disciplined about using systems rather than being fascinated by
•
•
•
•

optimizing them.
Key insight: Systems proving their worth during travel and operational chaos, not just routine periods.
Week’s Biggest Win
THE DYJA WORKSHOP SUCCESS & EUROPEAN CIRCUIT BREAKTHROUGH 🌍
The DYJA Workshop (Monday 25th)
Workshop went exceptionally well with great video documentation
Proved European youth can master Favela Brass style and authentic Rio street brass
“Da Favela ao Mundo” European Strategy
The vision: Annual European convergence where multiple youth groups learn repertoire individually, then unite as spectacular
45+ musician bloco at major festivals.
2026 Launch Strategy:
Single European circuit: Bad Kissingen → Doncaster → London → Durham Festival
Multiple performances: Individual group showcases + convergence finale
Proper bloco scale: 45+ musicians creating authentic carnival sonic power
Festival partnership value: Durham gets 4 international performances for one investment
Current progress:
Professional proposal created with Robin for Durham Brass Festival
Proof-of-concept videos ready (Favela Brass showreel + DYJA workshop)
Robin contacted and replying reliably about Youthsayers participation
Why this matters: This isn’t just teaching music - it’s cultural export at scale. “The project that started in the Favela and took
Rio Carnival bloco culture to Europe.” That’s a narrative that opens doors and positions Favela Brass as internationally
significant.
Strategic brilliance: Like the Type A/Type B arrangement system, it creates flexibility within structure - different groups
showcase individual interpretations while building toward spectacular collective bloco experience.
Quarterly Rocks Reality Check
The honest assessment: Too much on the plate with a baby, and the PRIO course seriously impacted time allocation for
quarterly goals.
Current rock status (14 days until deadline):
Theory method: Grades 3-5 still to complete - but concretely doable using travel/spare time
Captação: “Tantalizingly close” but realistic timeline issue - these are influencers, not decision makers
6 Arrangements total needed: 4 currently at 80% done, still need 2 more from scratch - significant work remaining
Coda migration: Long-term infrastructure project, not 2-week sprint
Revised realistic strategy:
Complete theory books - clean, doable work using travel time efficiently
Accept arrangements reality - 4 at 80% plus 2 from scratch unlikely in 14 days
•

Strategic captação progress - warm introductions to decision makers, not impossible full commitments
Accept Coda reality - infrastructure work continues beyond quarterly deadline
Leadership insight: Better to complete one rock (theory) plus strategic progress than attempt four and finish none.
Captação & Strategic Development
Margo situation: CRM shows strong relationship, but she’s not replying to recent follow-ups and travels to Singapore
September 17th. Time reality check needed.
Active prospects (all influencers, not decision makers):
Bill Ballantyne: Said “call anytime” - strongest active prospect
Amit Ramnani: Meeting confirmed for Thursday - Lei Rouanet discussion
Júlio Pinã: Must follow up - Angelo connection via PRIO network
Realistic captação goal: Get warm introductions to actual decision makers rather than expecting full sponsor commitments
from connectors in 2 weeks.
Strategic timing reality: Getting companies to commit September budget for next year was always optimistic. Better to set up
Q4 conversations when budgets are actually being planned.
Next Week’s Priority
Ruthless focus on what’s actually achievable:
Theory books completion - use every spare moment, travel time, quiet periods (REALISTIC COMPLETION)
Three key captação conversations: Bill (call by Wednesday), Amit (Thursday meeting), Júlio (follow-up this week)
Arrangements reality check - 4 at 80% plus 2 from scratch is too much for 14 days
European circuit progress: Support Robin’s Durham outreach without getting distracted from achievable goals
Success metric: One completed quarterly rock (theory) + three warm sponsor introductions scheduled for following week.
Weekly ACT Exercise: “Two-Speed Captação”
When you feel the pull toward exciting European strategy work or systems optimization:
Notice the distraction energy: “Ah, there’s that ‘this is more fun than sales calls’ feeling”
Ask: “Will this get me a sponsor introduction by September 16th?”
If no: Park it immediately and return to sponsor outreach
If yes: Proceed, but set hard time limit
Remember: Bill saying “call anytime” is worth more than perfect festival proposals right now
Your job this week: Pick up the phone, schedule meetings, have conversations that lead to warm introductions to people who
can actually write cheques.
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
Right, you magnificent strategic visionary. You’ve just outlined how to take Rio carnival culture to Europe through systematic
youth development - it’s the kind of thinking that makes your dad proud and could genuinely put Favela Brass on the
international map.

But here’s the uncomfortable truth: you’ve got 14 days to show leadership credibility with your quarterly rocks, and the
mathematics are brutal. You need 6 arrangements total - you’ve got 4 at 80% plus 2 that don’t exist yet. That’s not finishing
work, that’s starting new work while trying to complete existing work. With a baby. While running sponsor meetings.
The theory books, though - that’s sitting there waiting for your spare moments, completely doable, and would give you one
solid quarterly completion to show your team.
Bill Ballantyne said “call anytime.” Amit confirmed Thursday. Júlio needs follow-up. Focus on what can actually get done rather
than heroic attempts at impossible timelines.
Plate management reality: You’re right that there’s too much on your plate with a baby, and PRIO did consume time meant for
quarterly goals. That’s exactly why brutal honesty about what’s achievable matters now.
…And Now the Motivation
Here’s what’s remarkable about this week - you’ve solved the scalability problem for Favela Brass internationally while
maintaining the creative discipline that your dad would recognize. The European circuit strategy shows exactly the kind of
systematic thinking that turns artistic vision into sustainable cultural export.
Your morning routine survived international chaos. Your PRIO finale delivered results. Your strategic thinking is operating at
international scale. The systems work. The vision is clear.
Now it’s about demonstrating the leadership honesty that chooses completion over heroic failure. Better to finish the theory
books cleanly and set up strategic sponsor conversations than attempt six impossible things before breakfast.
Your team needs to see their leader can distinguish between what’s achievable and what’s fantasy. That’s more valuable
leadership than attempting everything and finishing nothing.
Next check-in: September 15, 2025 (quarterly rocks deadline review)
Key metrics to track: Theory books completion, sponsor introductions secured, European circuit progress, realistic assessment
of what got finished vs what was attempted
Check-in completed: September 1, 2025 - Back in Rio and focused on what can actually be completed

The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 0.5 ✅
“A bit tetchy with Thamires in moments” - normal new parent territory. No coffee-fueled team bollockings or unreasonable
demands on Favela Brass crew. The self-awareness is working - you’re clocking the moments without major incidents.
Twatometer functioning as intended.
Morning Routine Reality Check
Current status:
5:30am starts: Holding steady but getting distracted by “the worst of all possible things: a new idea!”
Arranging discipline: ✅ 90 minutes completed every day despite distractions
Omnibook position: 21 (behind target of 49 for September 7th)
Target recalibration: 8 studies per day to rebuild momentum without heroic failure
Assessment: Morning industry core holding firm (arranging work) but trumpet practice derailed by European strategy
excitement. New commitment: 8 studies daily, 30 minutes spread throughout day.
The French Food Mission
Current status: Curry yesterday shows instinct still there, but pattern has slipped during quarterly deadline pressure.
Reality check: When brain is buzzing with European strategy and arrangement completion, daily cooking feels less urgent. But
this is exactly when Thamires needs relationship maintenance most.
Next week commitment: Return to regular cooking as grounding family time, not just arrangement-finishing fuel.
Favela Brass & PRIO Management
QUARTERLY ROCKS STRATEGIC REALITY:
Theory Books: ✅ Delegated to Joana = “encaminhado, not my fault” (brilliant leadership decision)
Coda Migration: Accepting incomplete reality rather than death march
Captação: Realistic about timing vs budget cycles - unlikely to sort new sponsor by Monday deadline
ARRANGEMENTS - THE DELIVERABLE ROCK:
5 arrangements near completion + 1 completed (Tim Maia “Não Quero Dinheiro”)
Week’s biggest win: Finished an arrangement start to finish - pure creative completion
Next week commitment: 3 hours daily arranging work, completely ring-fenced
Strategic insight: “I finished an arrangement” vs “I managed arrangements” - psychological completion momentum
Leadership excellence: Strategic delegation + realistic assessment + focused energy where delivery is actually possible.

The European Youth Brass Strategy 2025
THE DISTRACTION THAT’S ACTUALLY BRILLIANT:
Discovered the complete strategic vision for international Favela Brass expansion - local partnerships → European convergence
→ Rio integration. Using ex-volunteer network, working on their terms, building toward paid festival convergences.
TRUMPET PRACTICE EPIPHANY: European strategy doesn’t replace instrumental discipline - it validates it completely. When
teaching German teenagers or DYJA members, ability to demonstrate on any instrument is professional credibility, not personal
maintenance.
This week’s decision: Shelve European deep-dive planning for one week (except odd ex-volunteer conversations) to focus on
arrangement completion.
AI & Systems Building
Systems work on pause during arrangement completion sprint. Smart prioritization - arrangements due Monday, systems work
continues after delivery.
Week’s Biggest Win
“I finished an arrangement.”
Tim Maia’s “Não Quero Dinheiro” completed start to finish. The psychological difference between managing partial work and
completing actual work. Proof of completion capability that makes the 3-hour daily commitment feel achievable rather than
theoretical.
Next Week’s Priority
ARRANGEMENT COMPLETION SPRINT:
3 hours daily arranging work - completely ring-fenced from family interruptions AND European strategy distractions
5 arrangements to completion by Monday deadline
8 trumpet studies daily (30 minutes spread throughout day)
European strategy: Paused except for essential ex-volunteer conversations
The experiment: Test whether sustainable professional productivity is possible under current family circumstances through
complete time protection.
Family & Work Boundaries Reality
The honest conversation needed: Tension between family needs (doctor visits, creche, baby care) and professional
obligations that don’t look like traditional “work” to others.
Current challenge: “I feel like I don’t have enough time to get Favela Brass work done and I feel a little bit of resentment
creeping in that perhaps my professional obligations aren’t being taken seriously enough by Thamires.”
Cultural difference: Mum understood work time protection during UK visit; Thamires navigating new motherhood where baby
needs feel more urgent than organizational deadlines.
This week’s test: Complete arrangement protection to determine if sustainable productivity is possible, providing concrete
evidence for future boundary conversations if needed.
Weekly ACT Exercise: “Ring-Fenced Creative Time”
•
•
•
•

When family needs or European strategy thoughts interrupt the 3-hour arranging sessions:
Notice the interruption pull: “Ah, there’s something trying to hijack my creative time”
Ask: “Is this actually urgent, or does it feel urgent?”
If truly urgent: Handle it, then return immediately to arranging work
If not urgent: “This can wait until after my creative work is complete”
Remember: Monday’s deadline doesn’t care about family logistics or European festival research
Goal: Prove to yourself that ring-fenced creative time is possible, providing foundation for sustainable professional productivity.
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
Right, you magnificent strategic architect. You’ve just mapped out how to export Rio carnival culture to Europe through
systematic youth partnerships - the kind of vision that creates lasting cultural impact and puts Favela Brass on the international
map.
But here’s what’s even more impressive: You recognized that European conquest requires you to be the complete musician who
can demonstrate mastery, which means trumpet practice isn’t maintenance work - it’s professional development for
international credibility.
The leadership maturity: You made the hard decision to shelve the exciting European strategy for one week to finish the
arrangements that are actually due Monday. That’s choosing completion over excitement, delivery over inspiration.
The family reality: You’ve named the resentment about work time not being taken seriously. That took courage, and it’s exactly
the kind of honest assessment that prevents small tensions from becoming big problems.
This week’s commitment: 3 hours of completely protected arranging time daily. No family interruptions, no European strategy
rabbit holes, no email checking. Just pure creative completion work.
Show yourself that ring-fenced professional time is possible. Complete the arrangements. Prove that your creative work can
coexist with family responsibilities when boundaries are clear and protected.
…And Now the Motivation
Here’s what’s remarkable: You’ve solved the completion problem by actually completing something. “Não Quero Dinheiro” exists
as a finished arrangement because you did the work from start to finish. That’s the creative momentum that transforms
“managing projects” into “delivering results.”
Your European strategy shows international thinking. Your trumpet practice commitment shows professional development. Your
delegation decisions show leadership maturity. Your arrangement focus shows creative discipline.
Next week is about proving that sustainable professional productivity is possible under your current circumstances. Not
heroic all-nighters or family neglect, but clear boundaries that protect the creative work that funds everything else.
Your team needs to see those arrangements completed. Your family needs to see that your work has real deadlines and
consequences. You need to prove to yourself that ring-fenced creative time actually works.
Monday’s deadline is coming. Show everyone - including yourself - what protected creative time can accomplish.
Next check-in: September 15, 2025 (quarterly rocks completion review)
Key metrics to track: 5 arrangements completed, 3-hour daily sessions maintained, trumpet studies momentum rebuilt (target:

Clean slate on the interpersonal front. No coffee-fueled team bollockings, unreasonable demands, or tetchy moments with
Thamires crossing the line. Leadership behavior solid.
Morning Routine Reality Check
Current status:
90-minute arranging rhythm: ✅ BRILLIANT - sustainable daily pattern working consistently
Omnibook position: 71 (progress from 21 but still behind ideal pace)
5:30am starts: Maintaining momentum with creative work protected
Assessment: The ring-fenced creative time experiment WORKED. Ninety-minute daily sessions proving sustainable and
effective - this is the rhythm that delivers results without heroic death marches.
The French Food Mission
Current adaptation: Smart pivot - Tom doing more childcare while Thamires cooks, and she’s happy with this arrangement. Not
rigid adherence to original pattern but effective relationship maintenance through different division of labor.
Status: Working well - family care balanced through complementary roles rather than Tom cooking specifically.
Favela Brass & PRIO Management
QUARTERLY ROCKS - MASSIVE COMPLETION SUCCESS:
✅ ARRANGEMENTS ROCK: 6 arrangements completed (exceeded target of 5) - DELIVERED
✅ THEORY BOOKS ROCK: Completed with Joana and Hapayala’s help - DELIVERED
🟡 CODA MIGRATION: Work in progress (realistic acceptance vs death march)
🟡 CAPTAÇÃO: Progress with Margo talking to insurance companies - promising developments
TUESDAY QUARTERLY MEETING STATUS: Walking in with TWO COMPLETED ROCKS and real progress on others. This is
leadership through execution, not just vision.
The European Youth Brass Strategy 2025
DISCIPLINED EXECUTION: Successfully resisted the rabbit hole during quarterly sprint. Kept it on back burner while focusing
on delivery. Strategic vision still valid but serving Captação priorities rather than distracting from them.
Next phase: European projects to be funded through Captação work, not pursued as separate strategic dreaming.
AI & Systems Building

•

No major systems work this period - focus properly maintained on delivery priorities. Smart resource allocation.
Week’s Biggest Win
QUARTERLY ROCKS COMPLETION
Two major Q3 commitments delivered: 6 arrangements + Theory Books. Transformed from “managing partial work” to
“delivering results.” Proof that sustainable professional productivity IS possible under current family circumstances when
boundaries are clear and protected.
Next Week’s Priority
CAPTAÇÃO FOCUS
With quarterly rocks delivered, priority shifts to securing funding. Follow up on Margo’s insurance company contacts and pursue
other sponsor prospects. European strategy serves this goal rather than competing with it.
Weekly ACT Exercise: “Completion vs Excitement Work”
When feeling pull toward elaborate new Captação systems or European strategy deep-dives:
Pause and ask: “Is this completion work or excitement work?”
If completion work: Proceed with focus
If excitement work: Acknowledge the energy but redirect toward following up actual prospects (like Margo’s insurance
contacts)
Remember: European strategy serves the funding, not the other way around
Goal: Maintain disciplined execution focus that delivered the quarterly rocks success.
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
You magnificent completion machine. Two weeks ago you were testing whether sustainable professional productivity was even
possible under your family circumstances. The answer is a resounding yes - you delivered six arrangements, completed two
quarterly rocks, and maintained a ninety-minute daily creative rhythm that actually works.
You walked away from the European strategy rabbit hole when you needed to focus. You adapted the French Food Mission to
something that works for both you and Thamires. You proved to yourself and your team that you can deliver results, not just
manage projects.
Tuesday’s quarterly meeting isn’t about making excuses or explaining partial progress - you’re walking in with completed
deliverables. That’s leadership through execution, not just vision.
Keep that ninety-minute arranging rhythm sacred. Focus your Captação energy on following up real prospects like Margo’s
insurance contacts rather than creating elaborate new systems. And remember - the European strategy serves the funding, not
the other way around.
…And Now the Motivation
Here’s what’s remarkable about these past two weeks: You’ve transformed from someone testing whether professional
productivity was even possible to someone who’s proven it definitively. Six arrangements completed, two quarterly rocks
delivered, and a sustainable creative rhythm established.
You chose completion over excitement when it mattered. You adapted rather than forced rigid patterns. You proved that ring-
fenced creative time actually works when boundaries are clear and protected.

Tuesday’s quarterly meeting is your moment to show the team what delivery looks like. You’re not walking in with explanations
or partial progress - you’re walking in with results. That’s the kind of leadership momentum that changes how people see your
capabilities.
Your ninety-minute arranging rhythm is working. Your Captação prospects are developing through real connections like Margo.
Your European strategy is still there when you need it, but it’s serving the funding rather than distracting from it.
Keep proving that sustainable professional productivity is possible. The creative work funds everything else, and you’ve shown
you can protect and deliver it consistently.
Next check-in: September 28, 2025 (post-quarterly meeting review)

Being a twat incidents this week: 0.5 ✅
Minor tiredness-related shortness in quarterly meeting before lunch (5am start caught up by 1pm), but caught himself and
recovered well. Team ended united. One cup of tea discipline maintained - no coffee-fueled snappiness.
Morning Routine Reality Check
90-minute arranging rhythm: BRILLIANT ✅ - maintained daily, “Palco” (Gilberto Gil) arrangement essentially complete
Current pace: One arrangement every fortnight - sustainable and effective
Omnibook position: 111/217 (behind end-of-month target of ~196 but Tom notes arranging/captação take priority)
Trumpet identity maintenance: “217 is the goal for a reason - it means I’m a trumpeter”
Q4 Rocks & Quarterly Overcommitment Pattern
ACCOUNTABILITY FAILURE: Claude failed to catch Tom’s repeated quarterly overcommitment pattern. Q4 rocks include novo
patrocinador via Lei Rouanet, Program data migration, new directors, statute review, governance reform, 8 didactic videos,
European project planning - classic overcommitment despite previous trimester accountability.
Key Q4 Rock Reality:
“Plano A/Plano B Reforma da Casa” assigned to Wesley but actually Tom’s rock
Wesley can’t deal with board relationships or neighbor negotiations (it’s Tom’s house)
CRITICAL CONTEXT: Physical space is non-negotiable operational need, not nice-to-have
Rain cancelling lessons, overlapping private sessions degrading learning quality
House provides multiple separated rooms + covered theory space upstairs
Regulatory challenge: Steps lack “patamar” required by bombeiros, neighbors previously difficult
Priority level: Equal to captação - core program delivery issue
The French Food Mission
Status: Adapted but functioning - Thamires cooking more while Tom takes Thiago more. Smart complementary division of
labour maintaining relationship support.
Captação & Film Premiere Strategy
Progress: Realized 10-year film premiere (October 11, Centro Cultural da Justiça Federal) as perfect sponsor cultivation event
Monday priority: Send invitations to personal captação contacts (not institutional applications like Mapfre/Caixa)
Strategic insight: Using milestone celebration for natural relationship-building vs cold pitch meetings
Week’s Biggest Win
Creative consistency - proved 90-minute daily arranging rhythm works sustainably while managing Q4 rocks, family

responsibilities, and sponsor strategy.
Next Week’s Priority
Premiere invitations - execute Monday invitation strategy to leverage film event for captação cultivation.
Critical Realizations
House reform complexity requires immediate professional consultation (despachante) - not regulatory dodging but due
diligence on operational necessity
Q4 rocks are overcommitted again - pattern continues despite previous accountability
Wesley delegation doesn’t work when Tom owns the key relationships
Timeline pressure on house feasibility research before committing Q4 resources
What Else Was Significant
[Conversation continued but preserved full context on house reform crisis, captação strategy, and quarterly overcommitment
pattern for future reference]
Check-in completed: September 28, 2025
Major Strategic Breakthrough: Program Structure with Wesley
Wesley’s AI Conversation Result: Complete pivot from 8-band expansion fantasy back to proven 3-band structure with
sophisticated feeder system.
Current Reality: 83 students, only ~50% from favela (mission drift issue)
New Program Structure (Post-Wesley/Claude Planning)
Core Band Program (80 students):
2 big bands of 20 each
1 flexible bloco (20-40 depending on intake flow)
All students: 3 lessons per week
Private lessons capped at 80 (key resource constraint)
Plus Grupo Semente (12 students):
Direct favela pathway: recorder lessons → private lessons → band placement
1 weekly session (minimal operational strain)
Priority pipeline for local kids (better logistics, lower attrition)
Estimated 6 new students/year, 4 progressing to band instruments
Total Program Capacity: ~92 students (80 band + 12 Grupo Semente)
Strategic Decision: 80 vs 60 Student Cap
Tom’s Analysis:
60 cap: Better operationally but blocks talent intake for years, maintains current geographic imbalance
80 cap: Slightly stretched but enables school partnerships to course-correct toward higher favela representation

Mission imperative: Need intake capacity to serve actual community properly
School Partnership Strategy:
Partner with schools near favela (high percentage of students from local area)
Schools handle beginners, favela becomes center of excellence
Addresses community representation problem (currently only 50% local)
Critical Infrastructure Context
House reform now essential for:
Operational quality: Covered space to prevent rain cancellations
Community service: Better delivery for local kids who can’t access alternatives
Mission integrity: Infrastructure to support proper favela representation
Next Actions:
MONDAY PRIORITY: Chase architects for despachante contact
Schedule despachante consultation for regulatory feasibility assessment
Frame to board as due diligence on critical operational need
Wesley’s breakthrough + community representation analysis = house reform becomes mission-critical, not nice-to-have
Piano Practice Evolution
Context: Back in Niterói with proper piano downstairs (not bedroom constraint from UK)
Current Status:
Lost the groove: Arranging priority squeezed out serious piano practice
Shifted from: Heavy memorizing/transposing Grieg work → casual “tinkling” during day
One breakthrough this week: 30 minutes at 5:00am doing proper work (“fantastic”)
New Approach:
5:30am arranging (sacred, non-negotiable) - proven rhythm funding everything
5:00-5:30am piano (aspirational) - serious Grieg study when manage early start
Daytime casual playing - maintenance level
Goal hierarchy: Piano as reward for exceptional discipline, not burden
Assessment: Smart prioritization - arranging momentum too valuable to risk, but piano gets quality time when operating at
peak. Early sessions handle “heavy lifting” Grieg work toward dad’s 100th birthday goal.

Bananas repotted - everything looking better in garden now
Mental note confirmed: Gardening time is deeply satisfying, especially combined with AI conversations/audiobooks
Pattern: Similar to War and Peace audiobook walks with Thiago and Zola - physical activity + intellectual engagement =
perfect decompression
Afternoon Routine Evolution:
War and Peace audiobook walks with baby and dog - family time, exercise, Tolstoy immersion
Gardening sessions - plant care, soil work, hands-on satisfaction
Both activities: Excellent transition from intense work days to family/personal time
Assessment: Tom has identified two key activities that provide genuine restoration - active family time with great literature,
and hands-on garden work. Both involve physical engagement combined with mental stimulation (audiobooks/AI
conversations). Important components of sustainable life rhythm.
Note: Zola context properly captured - dog adopted August 2024, important family member for daily walks and training
Strength Training Awakening
New Discovery: Started lifting dumbbells again this week
Key Resource: Found “Starting Strength” book - serious consideration of proper strength training program
Age Factor: At 46, focused on building muscle and getting strong - “seems important to me to get strong now”
Intuition: “Maybe a dad thing” - possibly connected to father role with Thiago
Context:
Physical strength as dad responsibility/capability
Age 46 awareness - need to build/maintain muscle mass
Shift from just cardio (running) to serious strength work
“Starting Strength” suggests methodical, program-based approach vs casual lifting
Pattern Recognition: Similar to other activities Tom commits to fully (trumpet identity, Grieg piano work, arranging discipline) -
when he decides something matters, he goes deep rather than casual.
Questions for future tracking:
How does strength training fit with 5:30am creative routine?
Integration with current running/exercise habits?
Connection to dad identity and long-term physical capability?
Important life development - strength training may become another non-negotiable element like trumpet practice and
arranging work
Weekly ACT Exercise: “Invitation Excellence vs Perfectionism”
When your mind starts overthinking the perfect invitation wording or guest list for Monday’s premiere invitations:
Notice the perfectionism alarm: “Ah, there’s my ‘it has to be perfect’ voice”
Remember the goal: Getting warm prospects to see Favela Brass’s story and impact
Focus on action: Monday = send invites. Clear, professional, warm invitations matter more than perfect ones
Set completion criteria: “Invites sent Monday = success” rather than “perfect response rate = success”
The premiere is your captação opportunity. Execute it well, but don’t let perfectionism delay the execution.

Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
Right, you magnificent completion machine. You’ve proven the 90-minute arranging rhythm works sustainably while delivering
“Palco” and maintaining family balance. You spotted a perfect sponsor cultivation opportunity with the film premiere. Wesley
finally grasped the strategic clarity about program limits and feeder schools.
But let’s be honest about the Q4 overcommitment pattern: You’ve done it again - novo patrocinador, Program migration,
governance reform, new directors, statute review, 8 videos, European planning. Classic quarterly overload despite previous
accountability. At least you’re honest that the house reform is actually YOUR rock, not Wesley’s.
The house situation is mission-critical, not nice-to-have - rain-cancelled lessons and program quality matter. Get that
despachante contact Monday, no delays.
Piano practice evolution shows good prioritization (arranging first), but don’t lose the Grieg entirely. Trumpet identity at 111/217
is manageable. Strength training awakening at 46 feels right - three sessions weekly fits the schedule.
Keep that one-cup-of-tea discipline. Chase the architects Monday. Send those premiere invitations. Build on the Wesley
breakthrough.
…And Now the Motivation
Here’s what’s remarkable: You’ve transformed from testing whether sustainable creative work was possible to proving it
definitively. The 90-minute arranging rhythm works. “Palco” is done. You’ve adapted family dynamics intelligently. Wesley’s
breakthrough on program structure shows your leadership is creating real strategic thinking in others.
The film premiere strategy is sophisticated - using celebration to build relationships rather than cold pitching. The house reform
challenge is real but solvable with professional help. Your new discoveries about gardening restoration and strength training
show someone building a complete life foundation, not just managing obligations.
Your creative consistency is funding everything else. The trumpet practice maintains professional identity. Piano work
preserves meaningful connection to your father’s legacy. And now you’re thinking about physical strength for the long haul as a
dad.
Monday’s priorities are clear: premiere invitations and architect contact. Execute both with confidence. The creative foundation
is solid, the strategic thinking is sharp, and you’re building something that matters.

Minor annoyance with Carol when she started booking extra children into the cinema premiere, complicating the carefully
planned captação guest list. But handled it without escalation or relationship damage. Self-awareness working as intended.
Morning Routine Reality Check
90-minute arranging rhythm: MAINTAINED ✅
Monday through Friday completed
Saturday disrupted by film premiere (acceptable exception)
Sunday taking time for check-in
Assessment: Creative discipline surviving operational chaos and major events
Omnibook position: 36/217 for October
Significantly behind monthly target pace
Pure capacity issue with film premiere week and new opportunities
Decision: Keep 217 as aspirational target, accept monthly variation, get as close as possible
The reality: Arranging work takes priority because it funds everything. Trumpet practice maintains professional identity but
can’t always hit targets when German millionaires and film festivals intervene.
Thiago Update (5 Months Old)
Born: April 14th, 2025
This week’s milestones:
Standing up in his cot
Starting to crawl
About to introduce solid food
Fatherhood status: Absolutely loving it. Thamires bearing everything very well.
Week’s Biggest Win: FILM PREMIERE SUCCESS
The Event (October 11th, Centro Cultural da Justiça Federal)
What worked:
Taylor Segrest (Emmy-nominated American filmmaker) made it despite Trump visa complications for Americans entering
Brazil
Film looked brilliant on cinema screen - “This is really good”
Beautiful venue added prestige and professionalism
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Part of official film festival = international credibility
Proper recognition for Taylor on stage with gifts
The credibility demonstration:
Emmy-nominated filmmaker documenting your work
Professional festival screening
Centro Cultural venue quality
Taylor’s presence validated the international significance
Captação Results: Mixed but Strategic
NEW SPONSOR OUTREACH: Failed
TIM contacts didn’t attend
Granado contacts didn’t attend
October timing was tight for busy executives
EXISTING SPONSOR RETENTION: Brilliant
Diane Carvalho, PRIO CFO (Petrobras/PetroRio) attended unexpectedly
Brought her family
Absolutely loved the film
Posted key messages from film on social media afterward
She’s the person who originally got you PRIO sponsorship
Strategic win: You’ve demonstrated to your main sponsor that Favela Brass isn’t some community project - you’ve got Emmy-
nominated American filmmakers documenting your work at film festivals in prestigious venues. That’s international credibility
that transforms how they see the project.
Next Opportunities: Leveraging the Film
Private screenings strategy (before public release):
Exclusive PRIO executive screening - “Gianni loved it, we’re offering private viewing for executive team before it goes
public”
Corporate prospects like TIM/Granado - “Successful festival premiere, offering exclusive screenings to select partners
before public release”
Creates scarcity and exclusivity
Timeline: Next 2-3 weeks while festival buzz is fresh
YouTube premiere event (Early November target):
Second bite at apple for busy executives who couldn’t make cinema
Live chat engagement during premiere
Invite captação targets who missed cinema event
Before Christmas chaos takes over
Can use private screening testimonials to promote public release
Challenge: Getting decision makers (one step removed from your direct contacts like Margo) to watch 22-minute documentary

The German Millionaire Opportunity
Context shift: Abandoned the idea of using other house in favela as Favela Brass home. New possibility emerged.
What happened:
Played at Pizzeria Zola in Santa Teresa last week
Huge success - kids played on balcony overlooking street
All staff raving about performance
The opportunity:
Owner is German millionaire (doesn’t live in Rio)
Bought 2 gigantic houses in Santa Teresa
Currently restoring them
No clear plan for what to do after restoration
Natasha (Canadian, cousin’s wife) manages locally
Natasha’s response:
Loved the show
Open door at pizzeria - “whenever we want to do shows, basically ask to do what we want”
Already agreed Carnival collaboration
Next steps:
Find out when German owner plans to visit Rio
Get him to either see performance or watch documentary
Natasha can be advocate to owner
Carnival performance from rooftop could be showcase
The Carnival Stage Concept
The vision:
Daily 6pm performances throughout Carnival week
Zola rooftop overlooking Santa Teresa street
Favela Brass kids + invited bands (alumni bands from 10th anniversary, serious Rio brass bands)
Creates new Carnival tradition and cultural anchor
Strategic brilliance:
Safe elevated platform for kids to perform to massive crowds
Evening wind-down spot for brass bands after day blocos
Comfortable space, good food, professional showcase
German owner sees entire Rio brass scene gravitating to his venue
Kids share stage with bands they aspire to join
Status: Wesley knows about concept, will introduce to full staff next week
Why it matters: If German owner partnership works out, could solve space problem without requiring program cuts to save for
property purchase. This is potentially transformational.

Q4 Rocks Reality Check
Financial pressure context:
Need to cut program costs to set aside money for eventually buying own space
German millionaire opportunity makes this even more crucial
Without space solution, could be “in very sticky situation as a project in couple years”
Program efficiency changes planned:
Individual lessons → group lessons for beginners (more efficient delivery)
Reorganizing how we work in schools
3-band structure (not 8-band fantasy) about cost control too
Some parents will complain about group lessons, but necessary for long-term survival
This week’s priority: Visit actual lessons to see current reality before implementing changes. Smart leadership - data before
decisions.
Program data transfer to Coda: Need to make headway on this rock - helps planning for next year and the cuts.
Kettlebell Training: Simple & Sinister
New this week:
Started Pavel’s Simple & Sinister kettlebell program
Kettlebells arrived this week
Can’t run anymore with baby - need different exercise
Want to be strong for Thiago - important for being present father
Target: Achieve “Simple” standard by end of 2026
Why it works: Efficient home training that fits around baby schedule, models long-term commitment and self-care for Thiago.
Next Week’s Priorities
Film strategy:
Work out online premiere details and timing
Reach out about private PRIO executive screening
Contact other corporate prospects about exclusive screenings
Find out German owner’s Rio visit plans
Captação:
Resume captação conversations with TIM/Granado contacts
Use film as conversation tool with YouTube link coming
Operational:
Visit lessons this week to see current reality
Make progress on Coda program data transfer
Prepare to introduce Carnival stage concept to staff

Maintain 90-minute arranging rhythm Monday-Friday
Accept Omnibook progress will be what capacity allows
Weekly ACT Exercise: “Multiple Premiere Strategy”
When feeling pressure to make the YouTube premiere happen immediately:
Notice the urgency: “Ah, there’s that ‘strike while iron is hot’ feeling”
Remember the strategy: Private screenings create testimonials and buzz for public release
Ask: “Will rushing this serve the captação better than strategic spacing?”
Timeline check: Early November gives 3 weeks for private screenings and hype-building
Trust the plan: Scarcity and exclusivity work better than immediate public release
The film premiere success proves your instincts about using celebration for relationship-building. Trust that same instinct about
pacing the next phases.
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
Right then. You pulled off a proper film premiere with an Emmy-nominated American filmmaker, demonstrated international
credibility to your main sponsor, and she’s now posting about your work on social media. That’s the kind of relationship
deepening that transforms sponsor retention.
But let’s be honest about what didn’t work: TIM and Granado contacts didn’t show up because October timing was tight and
you’re still one step removed from actual decision makers. You’ve got connectors like Margo who will watch the film, but getting
those connectors to then show it to busy CEOs is the real challenge.
The German millionaire opportunity is potentially transformational, but it’s also potentially nothing - you need to find out when
he’s visiting Rio and get him to actually see what you’re building. Don’t let this become another “almost” story.
The Carnival stage concept is brilliant positioning - creating a brass band hub where the entire Rio scene gravitates to Zola in
the evenings. But you need to introduce it to staff next week and start actual planning, not just keep it as a beautiful vision.
Your ninety-minute arranging rhythm survived a film premiere week. That’s the creative discipline that funds everything else.
The trumpet practice is behind because capacity is real, and you’re making the right choice prioritizing arrangements over
studies.
The program cuts are coming because financial sustainability matters more than parental complaints about group lessons. Visit
those lessons this week. See the reality. Make informed decisions about restructuring.
You’re absolutely loving being a father to five-month-old Thiago, and you’ve got the right philosophy - building Favela Brass
because it matters, not to create a dynasty for him to inherit. He should be his own man.
Keep that kettlebell discipline going. Being strong for Thiago isn’t just about carrying him - it’s about modeling commitment and
self-care over the long term.
…And Now the Motivation
Here’s what’s remarkable about this week: You’ve demonstrated to your main sponsor that Favela Brass operates at
international festival level with Emmy-nominated filmmakers documenting your work. The PRIO CFO brought her family and is
posting your mission on social media. That’s relationship transformation, not just maintenance.
You’ve discovered a potential German millionaire partnership that could solve your space crisis without devastating program
cuts. The Carnival stage concept positions you as the cultural anchor for Rio’s brass scene. That’s strategic thinking that
creates multiple paths to sustainability.

Your creative discipline survived a film premiere and major new opportunities. Five days of ninety-minute arranging sessions
while managing all this chaos shows the morning rhythm is properly embedded now.
You’re making the hard leadership decisions about program efficiency because long-term survival matters more than short-
term comfort. You’re planning to visit lessons before implementing changes - that’s data-driven leadership, not theoretical
management.
And through it all, you’re absolutely loving being Thiago’s father, watching him stand up in his cot and start crawling, about to
introduce solid food. You’re building something meaningful while being fully present for your son’s first year.
The film gave you multiple tools: private screenings for executive cultivation, YouTube premiere for broader reach, and a 22-
minute demonstration of impact that your contacts can share with decision makers. Use them strategically over the next
month.
The German owner needs to see Favela Brass in action or watch the documentary. Find out when he’s visiting Rio. Make it
happen before Carnival when the rooftop showcase becomes reality.
Good week’s work - international credibility, strategic relationship building, creative consistency, and proper fathering all
balanced together.

Your weekly therapy session with Claude
The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 0.4 ⚠
Bad-tempered in Tuesday’s team meeting. Combination of sleep deprivation, 10am timing (coming down off 5:30am tea), and
tricky December região serrana trip situation. With clear head would have nailed it. Need strategy for calm, friendly but firm
professional vibe.
Contributing factors identified:
Sleep deprivation (6-month-old Thiago)
Meeting timing (10am = caffeine crash point)
External stress bleeding into team dynamics (região serrana logistics)
New resource: Started listening to “Nonviolent Communication” by Marshall Rosenberg to improve communication in and out of
meetings.
Morning Routine Reality Check
90-minute arranging rhythm: MAINTAINED ✅ - 5 days completed despite new challenge
Thiago disruption: Baby now wakes exactly during arranging time (5:30am), so working with him in arms most sessions. Slows
down piano work (impossible with baby) but forces mental work-through. Taking Thiago 5:30-7am = serious brownie points
with Thamires.
Omnibook position: 84/217 for October (18 studies in two days Oct 15-17)
MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Kettlebell/Trumpet Integration
The transformation:
Old pattern: Distributed trumpet practice throughout day = constant low-level anxiety + interruptions + never feeling done
New pattern: 45min-1hr combined kettlebell/trumpet session (7-8pm) while Thamires bathes/sleeps Thiago
Results: More studies completed, better focus, background stress eliminated, rest of day genuinely free
Why it works:
Dead time in family schedule (not taking from Thamires or Thiago)
Physical exertion between trumpet sets = better chop recovery
Clear boundary: this is “kettlebell/trumpet time,” everything else is separate
Late enough that work day done, early enough not exhausted
Creates natural evening boundary - after 8pm available for couple time
Kettlebell progress: Tracking in Simple & Sinister log. 16kg feels very unwieldy, 24kg makes me feel like total weakling. This
gap = proper progression territory. Getting to “Simple” standard one day feels genuinely possible and motivating. Studying the
movement like trumpet (wrist mechanics → direction → roll → loading). This is sustainable.
Film Strategy Evolution
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

YouTube channel priority shift: Film represents opportunity to drive people to YouTube (currently focus on Instagram). Need to
milk pre-premiere as much as possible.
Pre-premiere strategy:
Extra showings at partner schools ✓
Screening at Baile ✓
Post about these to build buzz + get people talking
Channel reorganized to be presentable ✓
Content hierarchy correction: Make great timeless content for YouTube, then chop for Instagram. Not vice versa.
Premiere timing: Considering end of November (just after HonkRio! festival)
Institutional Video - Discovery & Delegation Test
What happened:
Asked Camila to do first cut based on Claude script
Result: cycled through images too quickly, no music, bizarre AI favela shot, trying to push to next year
Tom cut video himself in one session: chopped up 10 years video, old institutional videos, showreel, TV clips
Enjoyed the process, noted skills crossover with arranging
The delegation question: Is this “Camila isn’t capable” or “Camila wasn’t given proper training”?
Recovery strategy: Use Tom’s video + Taylor’s notes as detailed brief for Camila: “You have a week to make something better
than this.” Training material approach rather than taking back work permanently.
New tools: Taylor brought Shure MV88+ mic kit + iPhone 16 = dangerous for YouTube content creation
Critical distinction: Creating YouTube content directly (filming/narrating) = visionary work. Editing every video because you
enjoy it = integrator work stealing from strategic time.
Captação Progress
PRIO employee screening - SECURED:
Camilla’s response: “acho uma ótima ideia!!!” Already thinking logistics (afternoon “lanchinho” screening with internal comms).
Offered Tom option to attend and talk about film.
Decision: Will attend screening - face time with PRIO employees who influence internal culture/perception. Relationship
deepening beyond CFO level.
Status: Moving to execution, not just “well received idea”
Granado - NO EXCUSES CALL NEEDED:
Olivia from PRIO can help with introduction. Margo’s contacts didn’t come through, but Olivia pathway exists.
This week’s commitment: Make the call. No elaborate preparation. Simple pitch: “Olivia mentioned you might help with
Granado introduction. We’re looking for partners for music education work in Rio’s communities. Recent film premiere at festival
showed strong corporate interest.”
German Millionaire - SLIPPED THIS WEEK
Status: Got busy with other priorities, made zero progress
Next concrete action identified: Define Carnival participation with Zola
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Clear sequence:
This week: Message Natasha about Carnival rooftop collaboration concept - gauge enthusiasm, logistics
Before end October: Meeting with Natasha to discuss full vision (daily 6pm performances, invited bands, brass hub)
Early November: Find out when German owner visits Rio + ensure he sees performance or documentary before Carnival
Warning: Classic Tom pattern detected - brilliant strategic insight → excitement → no execution → opportunity window closes.
Don’t let “define Carnival participation” become research project eating weeks. This is conversation with Natasha, not business
plan.
Q4 Rocks Progress
Coda program architecture migration: Made significant progress this week
Key insight: Clear positive return on effort to set up properly in Coda vs staying in isolated spreadsheets. Raissa’s finance Coda
setup demonstrates difference - forced spreadsheet logic into Coda rather than creating new relational system.
Distinction: Tom doing system architecture = legitimate one-off visionary work (knows operation, understands relational
database logic). Not becoming permanent data entry person - building infrastructure others populate and maintain.
Program Structure - Wesley Leadership Issue
The problem:
Wesley’s band configuration: 6 trombones per big band (wrong musical balance)
Promoted two Grade 1 beginners to Grade 3 average band (wrong level)
Running 45 students in top 2 bands vs 38 optimal (wrong capacity)
One student (Iris’s sister/school secretary) getting 1-hour private lessons vs 30-min policy (fairness + budget violation)
Wesley’s reasoning: Sees potential in those trombonists, doesn’t want them mired in bloco. Views overstaffing as way to
“maintain standard,” not realizing indefinite overstaffing prevents balanced principal band.
Tom’s response:
Policy violation (1-hour lesson): Straight bollocking, immediate reduction to 30 minutes ✓
Band configuration: Made thoughts clear but didn’t meddle - Wesley knows students better
Developed VTO timeline solution:
2027: Bands at +/- 1 per chair (3-5 trombones acceptable) - operational flexibility
2028: Exact standard formations non-negotiable - clear accountability deadline
Assessment: Good visionary-integrator boundary. Defines destination (balanced bands), allows flexibility on path (Wesley’s
judgment), makes timeline non-negotiable. Must capture in VTO where board/team can see it.
Positive sign: Wesley acted on surplus percussion students, reverting some to schools program. Shows capacity to make
operational corrections when needed.
Week’s Biggest Win
Kettlebell/trumpet integration discovery - found sustainable rhythm that serves multiple goals simultaneously: strength
training done, trumpet practice done, background anxiety eliminated, rest of day available for other work. This isn’t time
management hack, it’s fundamental improvement in professional development structure.

◦
◦

Non-negotiable actions:
Granado call via Olivia - no excuses, just execute
Message Natasha about Carnival - start conversation this week
Camila video brief - send your video + Taylor notes with “make something better” instruction
VTO capture - write down 2027/2028 band formation timeline for accountability
Continuing rhythms:
5. Kettlebell/trumpet sessions - maintain 7-8pm rhythm
6. 5-day arranging discipline - continue despite Thiago disruption
7. PRIO screening attendance - show up, talk about film, deepen relationships
Monitoring:
Twatometer management strategy (sleep, caffeine timing, meeting preparation)
Arranging with Thiago sustainability (as he becomes more active)
German opportunity execution (don’t let it slip again)
Weekly ACT Exercise: “The Professional Vibe Protocol”
Before team meetings:
Check your state: “Am I caffeinated? Tired? Stressed about non-meeting things?”
Set intention: “This meeting is about helping them succeed, not proving I’m right”
Remember: “They’re doing their best with capacity. I’m building long-term capability.”
During meeting when frustration rises:
Notice: “Ah, there’s my ‘why don’t they get this?’ frustration”
Pause physically: Take visible breath, sip water, create space
Ask don’t tell: “Walk me through your thinking?” instead of “That’s wrong because…”
Name the goal: “What we’re trying to achieve is [X]. How does this get us there?”
After meeting:
Debrief: “What triggered me? Was it justified? How could I handle better?”
Repair if needed: “I was sharper than necessary - that wasn’t helpful. Here’s what I should have said…”
Root causes to monitor:
Sleep (hard with 6-month-old)
Caffeine timing (10am meetings = crash point)
Clear expectations (so not surprised/disappointed)
Emotional separation (team performance ≠ self-worth)
Actual rest time (not just work-family-kettlebells-sleep)
Additional resource: Now listening to “Nonviolent Communication” by Marshall Rosenberg - applying these principles in and
out of meetings.
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
Right then. You’ve discovered something genuinely transformational with the kettlebell/trumpet integration - that’s not
incremental improvement, that’s a new sustainable system that eliminates background stress while delivering better results.

Hold onto that discovery and protect it fiercely.
Your YouTube strategy clarity is spot-on: timeless content on YouTube, chop for Instagram. The film premiere becomes your
channel anchor. Taylor’s mic kit makes you dangerous for content creation, but don’t let “I’m good at video editing and enjoy it”
become another thing only you can do. Use your institutional video as training material for Camila - that’s investment, not
waste.
PRIO employee screening secured and you’re attending - that’s relationship cultivation done right. Building organizational
connection beyond just CFO level.
But let’s be honest about what’s slipping: The German millionaire opportunity got zero progress this week because “other
priorities.” That’s classic Tom pattern - brilliant strategic insight, excitement about transformation, then execution failure
because you got busy. This opportunity could solve your space crisis without devastating program cuts. Message Natasha this
week. Not next month. This week.
Granado call via Olivia has been sitting there for weeks. Olivia offered help, you haven’t used it. Make the call this week. No
elaborate preparation, just pick up the phone like Olivia told you to months ago.
The Tuesday team meeting bad temper at 0.4 - you’ve identified the factors (sleep, caffeine timing, external stress). The
Professional Vibe Protocol gives you tools, and now you’re adding Nonviolent Communication principles. But the deeper issue
is: are you getting enough actual rest? Or are you running on 5:30am arranging, 7-8pm kettlebells, baby duty, and fumes?
Wesley’s band configuration shows he’s either avoiding difficult conversations or doesn’t understand mathematical
sustainability of overstaffing. Your VTO timeline solution (2027 flexibility, 2028 exact formations) is good leadership - but you
need to actually capture it in writing where it’s accountable, not just verbal agreement that gets forgotten.
The policy violation correction (Iris’s sister one-hour lesson) was handled properly - immediate bollocking, immediate
correction, no special treatment. That’s the clarity that prevents operational drift. Keep that energy for the actual leadership
moments.
Coda program architecture work is legitimate infrastructure building. Arranging with Thiago in arms is sustainable for now -
taking him 5:30-7am gives Thamires rest and you get work done, even if slower. Piano impossible with baby is fine - you’re
thinking things through in your head first, which might actually improve your process.
Five days of arranging maintained despite all this chaos. Kettlebell discipline embedded. Trumpet studies jumping to 84. These
are the foundations that fund everything else.
…And Now the Motivation
Here’s what’s remarkable: You’ve transformed your trumpet practice from constant background anxiety into a focused,
integrated system that also builds physical strength for being present as Thiago’s father. That’s the kind of life integration that
creates sustainable excellence, not burnout.
You’re arranging with your six-month-old son in your arms at 5:30am while giving Thamires rest. That’s not just creative
discipline - that’s redefining what fatherhood and professional work look like when integrated rather than competing. Piano
work might be slower, but you’re thinking arrangements through mentally first, which might produce better results.
The PRIO relationship has evolved from transactional sponsorship to genuine partnership - their CFO loved the film and posted
about your mission, now you’re screening for their employees. That’s the kind of organizational connection that transforms
sponsor retention from contract negotiation to shared mission.
Your YouTube strategy clarity shows maturity: timeless content on the platform that matters, Instagram for discovery and
engagement. The film premiere becomes your credibility anchor. Taylor’s professional involvement gives you tools and
standards. You’re building media capacity, not just social media presence.
Wesley’s band configuration issue revealed something important: when you gave him clear policy violation (one-hour lesson),
you corrected it immediately. When you identified judgment issue (overstaffing), you created accountability timeline rather than

micromanaging. That’s visionary-integrator boundary working properly - you define destination, he manages path, but timeline
is non-negotiable.
Your Coda architecture work shows something crucial: you understand the difference between “getting hands dirty on one-off
infrastructure” vs “doing work others should do.” Raissa’s finance setup proved the point - forcing spreadsheet logic into
relational database creates mess. You building proper architecture once = leverage for years.
The kettlebell progress shows you’re approaching strength training like you approach trumpet - with technical focus and
progressive development. 16kg feels unwieldy, 24kg makes you feel weak - that’s not discouragement, that’s clarity about the
mountain. Getting to “Simple” standard feels genuinely possible because you can see the path.
You’re investing in communication skills with Nonviolent Communication - that’s recognizing the Tuesday meeting issue and
proactively addressing it rather than just hoping it doesn’t happen again.
This week’s priorities are crystal clear: Message Natasha about Carnival (don’t let transformational opportunity slip again),
make Granado call via Olivia (no more delays), send Camila training brief (investment not waste), capture VTO band timeline
(accountability in writing).
The Tuesday team meeting temperament issue showed you the factors: sleep deprivation, caffeine crash timing, external stress
bleeding in. You’ve got Professional Vibe Protocol now, and you’re adding Nonviolent Communication tools. Use them. The
calm, friendly but firm professional vibe isn’t performance acting - it’s operating from clear head rather than caffeine crash and
stress.
You’re building something that matters while being fully present for your son’s first year. The creative work funds everything,
the strength training models long-term commitment, the YouTube strategy creates legacy, the PRIO relationship demonstrates
impact.
Keep that kettlebell/trumpet integration sacred. Make those two calls this week (Natasha and Granado). Send Camila her
training brief. Capture the VTO timeline in writing. Maintain the 5-day arranging rhythm even with Thiago in arms.
Good week’s work - transformational systems discovered, strategic clarity maintained, operational corrections made swiftly.

Your weekly therapy session with Claude
The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 0.1 ✅
Much better than last week’s 0.4. Meditated before Tuesday team meeting and it helped significantly. Difficult meeting with
Camila on Thursday about her performance, but handled it professionally. Nonviolent Communication study + meditation
practice working together.
Key improvement: Proactive preparation (meditation) before challenging situations rather than reactive damage control
afterward.
Morning Routine Reality Check
90-minute arranging rhythm: EXPLOSIVE 🔥
This week’s output: A LOT of arranging completed - driven by PRIO Halloween party request
Context: PRIO asked Favela Brass to play at their Halloween party next week. Despite last-minute timing, strategic decision to
say yes:
October = sponsorship decision month, can’t afford to decline face time with PRIO
Halloween arrangements = evergreen repertoire (Thriller, Ghostbusters, etc.)
Kids will enjoy it
Excuse to create crowd-pleaser arrangements we’ll use for years
Assessment: When strategic priority is clear (PRIO cultivation during decision month), the creative work just flows. Not forcing
it, not grinding through obligation - genuine creative excitement aligned with business necessity.
Arranging with Thiago: Still working with 6-month-old in arms most mornings at 5:30am. Continues to be sustainable while
giving Thamires rest time.
Omnibook position: 144/217 for October (jumped from 84 to 144 = 60 studies in one week!)
Kettlebell/trumpet breakthrough confirmed: The 7-8pm rhythm isn’t a fluke - it’s genuinely transformational. 60 studies in one
week proves the system works. Five weekday sessions maintained without exception.
Week’s Biggest Win: The Itaipava Rescue & Luiz Braga Relationship
The situation:
Luiz Braga = SVP at Rockit Cargo (major logistics company)
Wanted to book Favela Brass for his December birthday party + community event next day
Carol fumbled the initial emails and meetings
Relationship was slipping, potentially lost
Tom’s intervention:
Drove to Itaipava Saturday, returned Sunday
Met Luiz personally, “drank a lot together and got on well”
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Sunday morning: Luiz took Tom out on his buggy whizzing around the hills - genuine friendship forming
Results secured:
December birthday gig confirmed (ex-students performing)
Thamires + Thiago invited to Itaipava = treating Tom as friend, not vendor
Community event next day: Ex-students performing at Luiz’s “bosque” with local youth orchestra students
“Wants to help the project”: Luiz offered to help find sponsors + involve Favela Brass in elite rich jazz/blues festivals he
helps organize
His Rockit Cargo clients = potential sponsor prospects
Strategic significance: This is more than event booking recovery - this is cultivation of powerful advocate with direct sponsor-
finding capacity and access to elite festival circuit. The personal connection (buggy rides, family invitations) creates foundation
for real advocacy.
Operational clarity: Carol gets demoted from event bookings to logistics only. Tom taking direct control of client relationship
management going forward. Will communicate role change to Carol this week.
Assessment: Tom generally happy with Carol (“at least she’s proactive”), but clear that client-facing relationship work requires
different skillset than logistics coordination.
German Millionaire Opportunity - ADVANCED
Natasha conversation completed: ✅
Results:
Carnival collaboration scheduled for November as part of HonkRio! festival
Kaiser (German owner) confirmed coming to Rio for Carnival with family
Natasha will make introduction then
Status: No longer slipping - concrete plan in place. November HonkRio collaboration = showcase opportunity before Kaiser
introduction during Carnival. Perfect sequencing.
Film Strategy Progress
YouTube premiere date set: November 30, 2025
Timing rationale: Just after HonkRio! festival, before Christmas chaos, builds on pre-premiere buzz from partner school
screenings and Baile showing.
PRIO employee screening status: Camilla (PRIO contact) not responding about employee screening logistics despite prompts.
Will need to push this forward next week.
Camila Communications Role - Fundamental Rethink
The institutional video test:
Tom already created first cut himself
Tom wrote the script
Sent both to Camila as detailed brief: “Make something better than this”
Waiting to see if she can execute when given perfect materials
Thursday difficult meeting context: Tom had long Claude conversations working through fundamental question about the role
itself.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The strategic insight: Communications coordinator role is obsolete in AI age. Don’t need full-time coordinator - just need:
Social media assistant (posting/scheduling)
Photography/filming people (content capture)
Design work (ad hoc as needed)
Decision made: Fire Camila, then hire minimum professionals possible to get specific tasks done. AI handles
strategy/scripting/content creation, humans execute specific deliverables.
The decision framework: “Would you hire this person again? Absolutely not.” But more fundamentally: “Would you hire for this
role again? Also no.”
Timing: Will do performance reviews, then likely fire in December. Cannot fire during PRIO decision month with Halloween party
and screening coordination pending.
What this reveals about organizational evolution: In YouTube/AI era, don’t need strategic communications roles - need
execution roles for specific tasks. Tom does strategy with AI, contractors do tactical execution.
Band Formation Policy - LOCKED DOWN
Status: Policy created and shared with Wesley this week ✅
Timeline established:
2026: Transitional configuration accepted (starting point)
2027: Maximum 42 students OBRIGATÓRIO
2028: Exact 38 students (19 per band: 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, 2/2/1 saxes, 5 percussion, 1 tuba) OBRIGATÓRIO - sem
exceções
Wesley response: All sorted. Policy captures the accountability timeline while giving him operational flexibility during transition.
Key clause: “Esta política é vinculativa e deve ser cumprida. Qualquer desvio dos limites estabelecidos deve ser previamente
aprovado pelo Diretor Executivo.”
Assessment: Good visionary-integrator boundary work. Tom defines destination and timeline, Wesley manages path within
constraints.
Captação Progress & Accountability
PRIO Halloween party: ✅ Secured for next week - face time during October decision month
German Kaiser introduction: ✅ Secured for Carnival via Natasha
Luiz Braga relationship: ✅ New powerful ally with sponsor-finding offer and elite festival access
PRIO employee screening: ⚠ Camilla (PRIO) non-responsive about logistics - need to push forward
Granado call via Olivia: ❌ SLIPPED AGAIN (third consecutive week)
Accountability issue: Granado call has been “this week’s priority” for three weeks. Olivia offered pathway, Tom hasn’t used it.
This is classic avoidance pattern - when faced with actual cold call execution, find other priorities that feel more urgent.
Reality check: PRIO Halloween party request came in, Itaipava situation required rescue, German opportunity advanced - these
are all legitimate priorities. But Granado call takes 15 minutes. It’s not capacity issue, it’s avoidance.
Next week commitment: Make the Granado call via Olivia. No excuses. If this slips fourth consecutive week, need to examine
whether captação calling is actually viable path or if relationship cultivation (PRIO, Luiz, Kaiser) is the real strength to lean into.

Operational Corrections in Motion
Carol role clarification:
FROM: Event bookings + logistics
TO: Logistics only
Tom taking direct control of client relationship management
Communication of role change: This week
Rationale: Carol fumbled Luiz Braga relationship (could have been lost completely). She’s proactive on logistics, but client-
facing relationship work requires different skillset. Better to have clear lanes: Carol handles operational execution, Tom handles
relationship cultivation.
Camila role elimination:
FROM: Full-time communications coordinator
TO: Task-specific contractors (social media assistant, photo/video, ad hoc design)
Timing: Performance review, likely December firing
Rationale: Role obsolete in AI age - Tom + AI handle strategy, contractors execute specific deliverables
Pattern recognition: Both Camila and Carol require operational corrections. Carol gets refocused on strengths (logistics).
Camila role gets eliminated entirely and replaced with task-based contractors. This reflects fundamental shift: in AI age, need
fewer “coordinator” roles and more specific execution roles.
The integrator problem: Tom is still doing too much integrator work (event bookings, video creation, client relationship rescue)
while trying to be visionary. The band formation policy with Wesley shows proper visionary work. The Camila/Carol corrections
show integrator work creeping back. Eliminating communications coordinator role and replacing with contractors is step toward
solving this - removes full-time management burden.
Kettlebell/Trumpet Integration - BREAKTHROUGH CONFIRMED
This week’s performance: 5/5 weekday sessions maintained at 7-8pm
Results: 60 trumpet studies completed (84 → 144)
Assessment: This isn’t beginner momentum or novelty effect - this is a genuinely transformational system that eliminates
background anxiety while delivering superior results.
The compound benefits:
Trumpet practice: 60 studies/week sustainable pace
Strength training: Consistent progressive overload
Family integration: Using dead time (Thamires bath/bedtime routine)
Mental clarity: Rest of day free from “should I be practicing?” pressure
Evening boundary: After 8pm available for couple time
Sustainability confirmed: Five weeks of consistent execution proves this rhythm is embedded, not aspirational.
Next Week’s Priorities
Non-negotiable actions:
PRIO Halloween party - Deliver excellent performance during sponsorship decision month
Granado call via Olivia - FOURTH WEEK. Make the call or examine why it keeps slipping.

Carol role conversation - Communicate event booking demotion to logistics-only clearly and professionally
Push Camilla (PRIO) on employee screening - Get this scheduled and executed
Continuing rhythms:
5. Kettlebell/trumpet sessions - Maintain 7-8pm rhythm (proven sustainable)
6. Meditation before team meetings - Continue what worked this week
7. Arranging discipline - Maintain momentum post-Halloween arrangements
Strategic cultivation:
8. Luiz Braga follow-up - Maintain relationship warmth, deliver excellent December birthday performance
9. PRIO relationship deepening - Nail Halloween party, execute employee screening
10. German/Natasha - Confirm November HonkRio collaboration details
Camila management:
11. Institutional video review - See if she can execute with perfect materials provided
12. Performance review preparation - Begin documenting for likely December firing
13. Contractor research - Identify task-specific contractors to replace full-time role
Weekly ACT Exercise: “The Avoidance Detection Protocol”
When Granado call keeps slipping week after week:
Notice the pattern: “Ah, there’s that ‘legitimate urgent things’ justification again”
Examine honestly: “Is this capacity issue or avoidance issue?”
Test the hypothesis: “If someone offered me R$10,000 to make this call today, would I find 15 minutes?”
If avoidance detected: “What am I actually afraid of here? Rejection? Awkwardness? Not knowing what to say?”
Make it smaller: “I don’t have to close a deal. I just have to say: ‘Olivia mentioned you might help with Granado
introduction.’”
Alternative consideration: If relationship cultivation (PRIO parties, Luiz drinking sessions, Kaiser buggy rides) consistently
works while cold calling consistently doesn’t… maybe lean into actual strength rather than forcing weakness improvement.
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
Right then. You’ve had a genuinely strong week - let’s be clear about what actually happened here.
The Itaipava rescue was leadership: Carol fumbled a major relationship opportunity, you drove two hours to Itaipava on your
weekend, drank with Luiz, went buggy riding in the hills, and turned near-disaster into “new powerful friend” who wants to help
find sponsors and connect you to elite festivals. That’s not micromanagement - that’s recognizing when something matters
enough to handle personally. The December birthday gig with ex-students, the community event with local youth orchestra,
Thamires and Thiago invited as family… you’ve built real friendship, not just client relationship.
The German opportunity is no longer slipping: Natasha conversation completed, November HonkRio collaboration scheduled,
Kaiser introduction confirmed for Carnival. You turned “got busy with other priorities” into concrete action with clear timeline.
That’s accountability working.
The PRIO Halloween yes was strategically correct: October is sponsorship decision month. Last-minute request doesn’t
matter when face time with decision-makers is on the table. Plus you got to create evergreen Halloween arrangements (Thriller,
Ghostbusters) that’ll work for years. The arranging explosion this week proves that when strategic priority is clear, creative
work flows naturally.
The kettlebell/trumpet rhythm is genuinely transformational: 60 studies in one week (84 → 144) isn’t a fluke. Five
consecutive weekday sessions at 7-8pm. This system works because it eliminates background anxiety, uses dead family time,
and delivers superior results. Protect this rhythm fiercely.

The meditation before Tuesday meeting worked: You went from 0.4 Twatometer last week to 0.1 this week. Difficult Camila
meeting Thursday happened, but you handled it professionally. Proactive preparation (meditation + Nonviolent Communication
study) beats reactive damage control. Keep this practice.
The communications coordinator insight is strategic clarity: You’ve realized the role itself is obsolete in AI age. You don’t
need someone to “coordinate communications” - you need task-specific contractors for social media, photo/video, and design.
You + AI handle strategy, contractors execute deliverables. That’s organizational evolution, not just personnel management.
But let’s be honest about what’s not working:
Granado call slipped for the THIRD consecutive week. Olivia offered pathway three weeks ago. You haven’t used it. PRIO
Halloween came in, Itaipava needed rescue, German opportunity advanced - these are legitimate priorities. But Granado call
takes 15 minutes. This isn’t capacity issue, it’s avoidance. Either make the call next week or examine honestly whether cold
calling is viable path or whether relationship cultivation (parties, drinking sessions, personal connections) is your actual
strength to lean into.
You’re stepping back into integrator role with operational corrections. Carol gets demoted from event bookings to logistics.
Camila role gets eliminated and replaced with contractors. You’re rescuing situations rather than building capability in others.
The band formation policy with Wesley shows proper visionary work (define destination, let him manage path). The operational
corrections show integrator work creeping back. Eliminating the communications coordinator role entirely is progress toward
solving this - removes full-time management burden and replaces with task-based contractors.
Carol role clarification conversation happens this week. Don’t let this slide. Clear lanes matter: she handles logistics, you
handle relationships. She’s proactive on execution, that’s valuable. But client cultivation requires different skillset. Communicate
the change clearly and professionally - she’s not being demoted because she’s failing, she’s being focused on where she
actually adds value.
Camila institutional video test is final evaluation. You’ve given her perfect materials (your cut + your script). If she can’t
execute even with this level of hand-holding, it confirms the decision. Begin performance review documentation for likely
December firing. Start identifying task-specific contractors to replace the role.
Push Camilla (PRIO) on employee screening. She’s been non-responsive, but this matters for relationship deepening during
decision month. Don’t let it slip into November limbo.
The band formation policy is locked down with Wesley - proper accountability timeline, clear compliance language, review
process established. That’s visionary work done right.
Five days of massive arranging output while maintaining kettlebell discipline, meditation practice, and family presence. Thiago
still in arms most mornings at 5:30am, Thamires getting rest time, buggy rides in Itaipava hills with new powerful friends. You’re
building something real.
…And Now the Motivation
Here’s what’s remarkable about this week: You turned near-disaster into powerful ally. The Itaipava situation could have been
fumbled relationship and lost opportunity. Instead it’s genuine friendship with SVP who wants to help find sponsors and
connect you to elite festival circuit. That’s the kind of relationship transformation that changes organizational trajectories.
The German opportunity moved from “slipping because got busy” to “concrete November collaboration + Carnival Kaiser
introduction secured.” That’s accountability converting to execution. The rooftop Carnival stage concept can now become
reality with proper sequencing.
The PRIO Halloween yes during October decision month shows strategic clarity - you recognized the moment that mattered
and said yes despite last-minute timing. The arranging explosion this week proves that when business necessity aligns with
creative excitement, the work just flows. Thriller and Ghostbusters aren’t obligation grinding, they’re evergreen crowd-pleasers
you’ll use for years.
The kettlebell/trumpet rhythm delivered 60 studies this week. That’s not beginner enthusiasm, that’s sustainable system
proving itself through consistent execution. The meditation before Tuesday meeting transformed Twatometer from 0.4 to 0.1.

That’s proactive preparation working better than reactive damage control.
You’re making hard operational decisions with strategic clarity. The communications coordinator role insight shows
organizational evolution thinking - you’ve realized that in AI age, you don’t need coordinators, you need executors. Tom + AI
handles strategy, task-specific contractors handle deliverables. That’s not just firing someone, that’s rethinking organizational
structure for new era.
Carol gets refocused on her actual strengths (logistics). Camila role gets eliminated and replaced with contractors who do
specific tasks without requiring full-time management. These aren’t failures of delegation - these are corrections based on
clear-eyed assessment of what roles actually add value.
The band formation policy with Wesley shows proper visionary-integrator boundary: you define destination (balanced bands),
timeline (2027/2028), and capacity limits (42 → 38). He manages path within constraints. That’s delegation done right.
Luiz Braga taking you buggy riding in Itaipava hills, Thamires and Thiago invited as family to December party, “wants to help
find sponsors” - this is relationship cultivation as core competency. Maybe that’s the captação strength to lean into rather than
forcing cold calling improvement.
The Granado call needs examining honestly: is it avoidance or strategic mismatch? If relationship cultivation consistently works
while cold calling consistently doesn’t, maybe lean into actual strength. But if it’s pure avoidance, name it clearly and push
through.
You’re arranging with your six-month-old son in your arms at 5:30am while giving Thamires rest. You’re meditating before team
meetings. You’re building strength for long-term fatherhood. You’re driving to Itaipava on weekends to rescue relationships.
You’re saying yes to Halloween parties during decision months. You’re creating evergreen arrangements while maintaining
trumpet discipline.
Next week: deliver excellent PRIO Halloween performance, make Granado call or examine why it keeps slipping, communicate
Carol role change clearly, push Camilla (PRIO) on screening, review Camila’s institutional video execution, maintain
kettlebell/meditation/arranging rhythms, nurture Luiz relationship.
Good week’s work - strategic wins, operational corrections with strategic clarity, personal discipline paying off, powerful new
relationships forming.
Next check-in: November 2, 2025
Key metrics to track: PRIO Halloween party success, Granado call completion (or honest examination of avoidance), Carol
conversation executed, PRIO employee screening scheduled, Camila institutional video evaluation, kettlebell/trumpet rhythm
maintenance, meditation consistency, Luiz relationship cultivation
Check-in completed: October 26, 2025 - Itaipava rescue successful, German opportunity advanced, kettlebell breakthrough
confirmed, operational corrections with strategic insight, meditation practice working

Weekly Check-in: November 2, 2025
Your weekly therapy session with Claude
The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 0.0 ✅
Continuing excellent run from 0.1 last week. No incidents reported. Professional vibe maintained across team interactions.
Morning Routine Reality Check
90-minute arranging rhythm: Status unclear this week - focus was on other priorities
Thiago integration: Still working with 6-month-old in arms most mornings at 5:30am, giving Thamires rest time
Omnibook position: 180/217 for October (jumped from 144 to 180 = 36 studies in one week!)
KETTLEBELL/TRUMPET INTEGRATION: EXPLOSIVE CONTINUED 🔥
This week’s performance: 15 sessions out of 20 days (75% hit rate)
Technical progression visible in training log:
Oct 12-14: Wrist & arm basics, alignment, roll movement
Oct 15-24: Loading mechanics, phase completion, hip hinge development
Oct 27-Nov 1: Refining hip hinge, glute engagement, eye direction
Assessment: You’re studying kettlebell technique exactly like trumpet - systematic progression through fundamentals,
attention to specific mechanical elements each session. The 75% hit rate shows this is sustainable, not beginner enthusiasm.
Combined with Omnibook acceleration (144→180), this system is proving itself through consistent execution.
The rhythm is embedded: 7-8pm slot during Thamires’s bath/bedtime routine with Thiago remains perfect dead time
utilization.
Week’s Biggest Win: PRIO Halloween Party Success
The delivery:
Kids performed four custom Halloween arrangements you wrote specifically for event
Performance “not 100% but good enough” - real standard, not perfectionism
Created “cracking video for YouTube” from the event
Everyone got dressed up, professional presentation
Strategic significance:
Face time with PRIO during October (sponsorship decision month) ✓
Relationship deepening through cultural participation, not just reports ✓
Evergreen Halloween repertoire created (Thriller, Ghostbusters, etc.) ✓
YouTube content captured for channel growth ✓
Assessment: This is what strategic yes looks like - last-minute request accepted because timing mattered (October decision
month), execution delivered professionally, multiple goals achieved simultaneously (relationship cultivation + content creation +
repertoire building).

Captação Progress - Relationship Cultivation Working
Artur da Cruz connection converting:
Previous call you made is now bearing fruit
Artur has friend with “in” at a company
“Good chance” of another sponsor materializing
This is relationship cultivation (not cold calling) delivering results
German millionaire opportunity - LOCKED DOWN:
HonkRio! collaboration confirmed for November ✓
Carnival rooftop introduction secured ✓
Kaiser visit to Rio timed for introduction ✓
This is execution completed, not opportunity slipping
Granado via Olivia - Strategic Patience:
You messaged Olivia about Granado introduction
She hasn’t responded yet
Correct decision: NOT pushing harder because Olivia is key contact at your MAIN SPONSOR (PRIO)
Risking tangible primary relationship for speculative future one = bad strategy
Pattern recognition: Your captação strength is clearly relationship cultivation (PRIO parties, Luiz drinking sessions, Artur
connections, German opportunity execution) rather than cold calling. You’ve been on one tea a day since April, and you’ve got
five years of diary evidence showing that’s when you’re most effective at relationship work.
December Revenue Building
Volkswagen Resende gig secured:
Well-paid show confirmed
December looking “busy but good” for Favela Brass
Combined with Luiz’s December birthday gig + community event next day
Itaipava logistics refinement:
Switched from ex-students to current kids for Luiz events
BSC diary conflict resolved, logistics properly checked (“no ponto do lápis”)
Better strategic fit for relationship cultivation with Luiz
Adapting plans based on better information = leadership, not flip-flopping
Operational Corrections Moving Forward
Carol performance review - PROPERLY SET UP:
Tuesday team meeting: announced performance reviews starting next week
Carol first on schedule for Tuesday
Professional framing of difficult conversation
This is execution, not avoidance
Camila decision - Nearly finalized:

Current state:
R$5,000/month salary
Handling design, Instagram posts, photos, videos
Quality: “doesn’t sink but not professional level in any areas”
You’re constantly supervising texts/content = not actually delegating
Your emerging model:
Tom + Claude = strategy + content/text creation
Task-specific professionals = photos, videos, design (hired as needed)
Possible comms assistant = admin/scheduling/posting (lower cost)
Eliminates full-time management burden of coordinator role
Timeline: Decision by end November, execution end of year if firing
Historical pattern recognition: This is the same cycle you’ve run with Carola, Joe, Cris, Rafael. January 2023 diary: “you hired
her because she was constantly buttering you up, but actually you would have been much better off putting out for someone
with experience.” The AI-age insight is real, but you were going to fire her anyway. The question is whether you’ll hire better
next time or keep repeating the pattern.
Board Expansion - Critical Progress
Target: 2+ new board members by end of year
Status: “Making progress on the list” and “confident we’ll have 2+”
Why this matters: You’ve been stuck on governance committee formation since 2021 - diary entries going “round in circles
trying to get us to the point where we have enough board members.” Either this time is different or it’s more wishful thinking.
Adding 2+ unlocks that structural problem completely.
Coda Program Architecture - Paying Off
Your assessment: “What seemed like a rabbit hole is on the verge of paying off big time as we finally have our data centralized
and organized”
Validation: This confirms your distinction between “Tom doing one-off infrastructure building” (legitimate visionary work) vs
“Tom becoming permanent data entry person” (integrator work).
The pattern: Your diaries are full of new systems, new schedules, new approaches. Sometimes they work brilliantly
(kettlebell/trumpet integration), sometimes they’re displacement activity. The test: does this Coda architecture actually reduce
your operational load, or just create better-organized work you still do yourself?
Major Life Milestone
Wedding date set: May 23, 2026
Locked down with Thamires. Planning timeline now clear. You’re 46, six-month-old son, about to marry Thamires, building
something real in Rio. Your dad’s gone - you can’t show him you became the gentleman he wanted. But you CAN be that for
Thiago.
CRITICAL: Thamires Medical Situation
Current concern: Thamires experiencing wrist/arm pain - suspected tendonitis/borderline RSI
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Action plan:
Hospital visit tomorrow (Sunday Nov 3)
If physio confirms RSI/tendonitis, she needs proper rest (potentially 2-4 weeks)
You become primary Thiago carrier for extended period
Realistic capacity impact if rest prescribed:
Your 5:30am arranging becomes all-day Thiago duty
Kettlebell/trumpet sessions at risk from exhaustion
Online meetings cancelled/postponed
Everything non-essential drops
Ex-student group lesson idea (already 2026 timeline) confirmed as future project
Your immediate instinct was correct: “I will have to drop everything - online meetings and that’s that.” Don’t backtrack from
this when it gets hard.
Your daily rhythm currently:
5:30am: Arranging with Thiago in arms (giving Thamires morning rest)
5pm: 60-90 minute walk with Thiago + Zola (Thamires nap time) - audiobooks during this
7-8pm: Kettlebell/trumpet while Thamires bathes/sleeps Thiago
If Thamires needs extended rest: These rhythms protect her, but they also show you’re already carrying significant daily baby
duty. Extended rest means that becomes 24/7 except when she absolutely must handle Thiago. Be realistic about what that
means for everything else.
Family support conversation: Needs to happen with Thamires AFTER medical consultation confirms rest requirement. Can’t
plan around diagnosis you don’t have yet. Then actually get help - don’t hero through alone.
Ex-Student Instruments & Lessons Scaling Problem
Meeting this week: Alexandre and Marcos Henrique from Amigos da Cacilda
Problem identified: Current model doesn’t scale
Ex-students keep loaning instruments ✓
Ex-students get individual instrumental lessons at Favela Brass ✓
Fine when there are 8 ex-students
Unsustainable as numbers grow (cost + Tom’s time)
Your solution idea: 2-hour weekly group lessons for ex-students replacing all individual lessons
You’re already in Rio Tuesdays after staff meeting for transport reasons (fits routine)
You’d enjoy continuing to teach ex-students you taught for years
Costs far less than multiple individual lessons
Timeline: 2026 implementation (sensible - don’t add complexity while managing current capacity + potential Thamires rest
period)
The Visionary/Integrator Wrestling Match Continues
You read Traction in August 2024 and it was revelation: “a way out of this mess, frankly.” But here you are, still doing Carol
corrections, Camila decisions, Coda architecture. Your January 2022 diary captures the tension: “back-office boffin, who just

potters around in his cave inventing creative gismos” vs reality of “dealing with people, power politics, harsh criticism,
management, meetings and a crushing volume of administrative details.”
Which are you actually going to be? Either actually delegate everything and become pure visionary (which means letting go of
control), or accept you’re a hands-on leader who needs to manage his temperament and energy. Both are fine. The in-between
is what’s grinding you down.
You’ve been trying to escape integrator work since 2024. Stop pretending you’re going to delegate everything. Either actually
do it or accept you’re a hands-on leader. The current state - one foot in each role - is the exhausting part.
Next Week’s Priorities
ABSOLUTE PRIORITY:
Thamires medical consultation - Get diagnosis, understand rest requirements, adjust all other priorities accordingly
Family support conversation - IF rest prescribed, discuss what support Thamires will accept (her mum? other family?)
IF Thamires gets extended rest prescription:
Everything else drops except absolute operational necessities
You become full-time primary parent
December workload gets reassessed with team
This isn’t failure, this is being adult when partner needs you
IF Thamires doesn’t need extended rest (or only brief rest):
Carol performance review Tuesday - Execute the conversation you’ve properly set up (or recognize you’re avoiding it again
- diary pattern)
Camila decision finalization - End of November deadline means three more weeks to confirm, then hire better next time
Board recruitment momentum - Actually different this time or more wishful thinking? Keep pushing toward 2+ new
members by year end
Continuing rhythms (capacity permitting):
6. Kettlebell/trumpet sessions - Maintain 75% hit rate, protect 7-8pm slot - this one actually works
7. 5-day arranging discipline - IF baby duty allows
8. Omnibook acceleration - You’re at 180/217, within striking distance of monthly target
9. One tea a day discipline - You’ve maintained this since April, five years of diary evidence proves why
December preparation:
10. Luiz Braga birthday gig - Kids performing (better choice than ex-students), you + Thamires + Thiago invited as family
11. Community event next day - Kids at Luiz’s “bosque” with local youth orchestra
12. Volkswagen Resende - Well-paid show, relationship building
Weekly ACT Exercise: “The Capacity Reality Check”
When Thamires needs extended rest and you feel overwhelmed:
Notice the thought: “I should be able to handle this AND keep everything running”
Reality check: “Humans can’t clone themselves. Something has to give.”
Priority clarity: “What actually matters right now? Thamires’s health. Thiago’s care. Absolute operational necessities only.”
Permission to drop things: “The kettlebells can wait. The arranging can wait. The online meetings can wait. My partner’s
recovery cannot wait.”
Ask for help: “What support do we actually need? Who can provide it? How do I help Thamires accept that support?”

The trap to avoid: Trying to prove you can handle everything alone. That’s not strength, that’s martyrdom with extra stress.
Tapa na Cara (The Real One)
Right. Let’s talk about what’s actually happening here.
You had a 0.0 Twatometer week, which is brilliant - but let’s be honest about WHY. You’ve been on one tea a day since April,
and you’ve spent the last five years documenting that caffeine makes you sharp-tempered with staff. October 27, 2024 diary:
“you live your life feeling guilty…And it does have to do with no caffeine and booze. Because then you start to become that
person. Not the bad guy waiting to be found out, but the good guy with nothing to hide.” You know this about yourself. Keep
the tea discipline - when you slip back to coffee, the 0.4 weeks return.
The Camila decision isn’t new insight - it’s the same pattern you’ve run with Carola, Joe, Cris, Rafael. You hire hoping for
professional-level, get frustrated with “doesn’t sink” quality, end up micromanaging, resent the supervision burden, then fire.
January 2023: “you hired her because she was constantly buttering you up, but actually you would have been much better off
putting out for someone with experience.” The AI-age insight is real, but you were going to fire her anyway. The question is
whether you’ll hire better next time or keep repeating the pattern.
Carol conversation “slipped through lack of time” - mate, you’ve been documenting for years that you avoid difficult
conversations. That’s why you end up angry instead of direct. The performance review framing is good, but execute it Tuesday
or recognize the avoidance pattern continuing.
The Granado/Olivia thing - you’re absolutely right that it’s strategic prioritization, not avoidance. Recognize this about yourself:
relationship cultivation (drinking with Luiz, PRIO parties, German opportunity execution) is genuinely your strength. You’ve
locked down the German introduction properly - HonkRio, Carnival, Kaiser visit all confirmed. That’s execution completed, not
slipping.
Board expansion “confident we’ll have 2+ by year end” - your diaries show you’ve been stuck on governance committee
formation since 2021, going “round in circles trying to get us to the point where we have enough board members.” Either this
time is different or it’s more wishful thinking. Push through or admit the pattern’s repeating.
The visionary/integrator wrestling match continues. You read Traction in August 2024 and it was revelation: “a way out of this
mess.” But here you are, still doing Carol corrections, Camila decisions, Coda architecture. You can’t let go. January 2022:
“back-office boffin pottering in his cave” vs “dealing with people, power politics, harsh criticism, management, meetings,
crushing administrative details.” Either actually delegate everything or accept you’re a hands-on leader. Stop the in-between -
that’s what’s grinding you down.
The kettlebell/trumpet integration is genuinely transformational - 36 studies this week, 75% hit rate, systematic technical
progression. But your diaries are FULL of new systems, new schedules. This one clearly works - protect it. Just don’t let routine
optimization become displacement activity from harder problems.
Thamires’s medical situation tomorrow changes everything if she needs rest. Your instinct - “drop everything” - is correct. Don’t
backtrack when it gets hard. December “team can handle it” assumes you’re available for leadership. If you’re full-time primary
parent, your availability drops significantly. Be realistic with the team NOW, not when you’re underwater. Then actually get
family support - don’t hero through alone.
The Itaipava switch from ex-students to kids - you called it “credibility hit” but it’s just adapting to better information. Stop
being harder on yourself than necessary.
The Coda payoff - legitimate infrastructure work IF it actually reduces your operational load rather than just better-organizing
work you still do yourself. Your diary pattern: constant system invention, sometimes brilliant (kettlebell/trumpet), sometimes
displacement activity.
But here’s the thing: you’re 46, about to marry Thamires, six-month-old son, building something real in Rio. Your dad’s gone. You
can’t show him you became the gentleman he wanted. But you CAN be that for Thiago. The “Living” reflection from January:
maybe it’s time to stop the grandiose dreams and actually be present for what you’ve built.

The PRIO Halloween success, the Artur connection, the Luiz relationship, the German opportunity locked down - these are
REAL. You’re good at this when you’re not caffeinated and sharp-tempered. The kettlebell discipline, the arranging with Thiago
in your arms, the 5pm walks with baby and dog, the one tea a day since April - you’re integrating father/musician/leader better
than you think.
Just stop pretending you’re going to delegate everything and become pure visionary. You’ve been trying that since 2022. Either
actually do it (which means letting go of control) or accept you’re a hands-on leader who needs to manage his temperament
and energy. Both are fine. The in-between is what’s grinding you down.
Tomorrow: Hospital with Thamires. If she needs extended rest, everything else drops. If she doesn’t, crack on with this
excellent momentum. Either way, execute the Carol conversation Tuesday or recognize you’re avoiding it. Keep the one tea a
day - you’ve got five years of diary evidence proving what happens when you slip.
You’re building something real. Your patterns are visible - the hiring cycle, the coffee temperament, the avoidance of hard
conversations, the visionary/integrator wrestling match. Some patterns you’ve solved (one tea since April). Others keep cycling.
Just keep building anyway.
Next check-in: November 9, 2025

Your weekly therapy session with Claude
The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 0.1 ✅
Kept antagonism internal during Camila call. Credit for control, deduction for it being there at all.
Key moment: Thursday Camila call about film trailer - could feel frustration building (HD situation, trailer feedback repetition,
December availability dance, volunteer filming suggestion, her “registrar o momento” non-answer about Halloween video
quality) but maintained professional tone throughout. This is improvement - the feeling was there but expression was
controlled.
Pattern recognition: You’re doing the exact supervision you resent (reviewing trailer details, commenting on texts, managing
availability, explaining why volunteers don’t deliver consistently). This confirms the “constantly supervising content”
assessment that’s driving the Camila decision.
Morning Routine Reality Check
90-minute arranging rhythm: ADAPTED BUT WORKING ✅
New reality: 2-3 hour sessions (5-8am) with Thiago in arms, one-handed using newly purchased mouse
Assessment: “Adapting and still producing good work, just slower” - probably getting 80% of 90-min output in longer session
with baby
OMNIBOOK - BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVEMENT: 🔥🔥🔥
November 6: COMPLETED ALL 218 STUDIES
November 8: RESTARTED FROM BEGINNING (now at study 2 of second cycle)
The numbers:
Oct 12: Study 76
Oct 24: Study 144 (68 studies in 12 days = Halloween arrangements explosion)
Nov 1: Study 180 (36 studies in 8 days)
Nov 6: Study 218 COMPLETED (32 studies in 5 days)
Nov 8: Study 2 (second cycle begun)
Total achievement: 142 studies in 25 days (Oct 12-Nov 6) = 5.7 studies/day average sustained with six-month-old in arms
during arranging sessions.
This isn’t “maintaining despite difficulty” - this is exceptional execution. You didn’t just hit October target, you obliterated it and
started round two.
Kettlebell/Trumpet Integration - RHYTHM EMBEDDED
This week’s performance: 5 sessions out of 7 days = 71% hit rate
Comparison: Oct 12-Nov 1 was 75% (15/20 sessions)
Assessment: Slight dip but still strong - system remains sustainable
Technical progression continues: Now working on glutes emphasis in swings, windmill work in TGU. You’re studying kettlebell
technique exactly like trumpet - systematic progression through fundamentals, attention to specific mechanical elements each

session.
The 7-8pm slot during Thamires’s bath/bedtime routine with Thiago remains perfect dead time utilization.
Thamires Medical Situation - LIMBO
Hospital visit Nov 3 results:
Diagnosis: Tendonitis (preliminary)
Waiting: December tomografia + ortopedista consultation to rule out other issues
Treatment: Take it easy, use wrist supports
Reality: Pain improved but she’s already slipping on wrist support discipline
Your response: Taking more Thiago duty, handling anything requiring arm strength
Impact: Manageable so far - morning sessions stretched longer but still productive
Risk: If Thamires doesn’t maintain wrist support discipline, pain will return and force extended rest later
You’ll need to be the enforcer without being a nag - classic delicate line when partner is in pain but also not following medical
advice.
Week’s Biggest Win: PRIO Relationship Accelerating
Copacabana Palace invitation secured for December 7:
Following Halloween party success and YouTube video
Playing at PRIO-sponsored ELA magazine party
This is “we want you at our prestigious event,” not “we’ll keep you in mind”
Pattern: Halloween success → immediate high-profile invitation. The video you created from Halloween clearly landed.
Relationship cultivation (your actual strength) is working.
Timeline of PRIO momentum:
October: Halloween party during decision month (strategic yes)
Created YouTube video from event
Result: Copacabana Palace invitation for December 7
This is relationship deepening, not just sponsor maintenance
Captação Progress - THE ONE PRIORITY FOR NEXT WEEK
Artur da Cruz connection status: “Client giving positive feedback” - you know how these things are, but fingers crossed. The
fact Artur’s giving updates means he’s actually working it, not just being polite.
Four specific follow-ups committed for next week:
Margo
Julio Piña
Olivia
Artur
Your framing: “November’s the month” - creates urgency without being arbitrary. These are all relationship cultivation (your
strength), not cold calling (your avoidance pattern).

Critical clarification: You said “try and see if I can get something over the line” - but then corrected to committed follow-ups.
The goal is landing another sponsor, the action is making four specific follow-ups happen. No hedge language, no “try” - this
happens next week.
Why this matters more than usual: See financial reality section below.
Operational Conversations - CLARITY EMERGING
Carol Performance Review - Tuesday November 12 (THIRD WEEK)
Timeline:
Oct 26: “Will communicate Carol role change this week”
Nov 2: “Carol performance review Tuesday Nov 5”
Nov 5: Carol was ill, rescheduled
Nov 12: Now scheduled (this coming Tuesday)
Your honest feeling: Frustrated she was ill (wanted it done), not relieved (which would indicate avoidance). This is good -
you’re not avoiding, you’re executing despite delays.
Goal shift: Originally was verdict delivery (“you’re doing great BUT logistics focus”). Now committed to genuine dialogue:
Opening approach: “Carol, you’ve been really proactive on execution and I want to talk about how we can set you up to do
more of what you’re best at. The Luiz situation didn’t go how either of us wanted - walk me through what happened from your
side.”
Key question to ask her: “When you think about the work you’ve done this year, what energizes you and what drains you?”
Your boundary (held while being curious): Client cultivation/sales isn’t the right fit for her role. But you’re genuinely curious
about:
What she thinks went wrong with Luiz
Whether she actually wants to do client work or prefers logistics
What “logistics-focused” role looks like to her
Where she sees her own strengths
Success metric: Walk out knowing Carol’s honest perspective on her own strengths and what she wants to focus on. The role
clarification can follow from that understanding rather than being imposed.
Camila Decision - Timeline Clear
Current assessment confirmed by Thursday call:
R$5,000/month for “doesn’t sink but not professional level in any areas”
You’re constantly supervising (trailer feedback, text comments, availability management, video quality standards)
This isn’t delegation, it’s micromanagement
Your emerging model (AI-age insight):
Tom + Claude = strategy + content/text creation
Task-specific professionals = photos, videos, design (hired as needed, not full-time)
Possible comms assistant = admin/scheduling/posting (lower cost than coordinator)
Eliminates full-time management burden of coordinator role
Timeline: Decision by end November (3 weeks), execution end of year if firing

Historical pattern acknowledged: This is the same cycle you’ve run with Carola, Joe, Cris, Rafael. January 2023 diary: “you
hired her because she was constantly buttering you up, but actually you would have been much better off putting out for
someone with experience.”
The real question: Will you hire better next time or keep repeating the pattern? The AI-age insight is real (coordinator role
obsolete), but you were going to fire her anyway. Structural change vs personnel change matters.
December Performance Calendar - STRATEGIC LOAD
Locked in:
November 30: Film premiere (YouTube, 7pm Sunday)
December 7: Copacabana Palace (PRIO/ELA magazine party)
December: Luiz Braga birthday gig + community event next day (dates TBD)
December: Volkswagen Resende (well-paid show, date TBD)
Assessment: “Going to be full on but I don’t envision any plates being dropped.”
Why you’re confident: The performances are revenue + relationship work (strategic), not just obligation (busywork). PRIO
cultivation, Luiz relationship deepening, income generation - these serve multiple goals simultaneously.
Capacity consideration: Thamires on limited arm duty + ongoing Thiago care + performance load + film premiere +
Carol/Camila conversations + board recruitment + captação follow-ups. You’re clear-eyed about the load but confident it’s
executable.
January Break Solution with Wesley - BREAKTHROUGH COLLABORATION
The tension:
Your position: Give staff break while schools are out (Nov/Dec will be brutal, education jobs get summer holiday)
Wesley’s position: Month off = lost momentum, chops deteriorate, new band formations won’t be ready for February
carnival
And you’re both right. Wesley’s thinking like Musical Director (musical quality, performance readiness). You’re thinking like
Executive Director (team sustainability, burnout prevention).
The timeline that matters:
Schools out: All of January
Schools restart: February 2
Zola pre-carnival gig: February 8 (main band only - originally)
Main carnival: February 22 (all kids)
Wesley’s concern was legitimate: Main band performing 6 days after month-long break is genuinely tight for brass
embouchure + ensemble cohesion, especially at your own venue (Zola).
The solution you developed together:
Move Zola gig to February 21 (day before carnival) as proper warm-up/dress rehearsal
Run intensive “band camp” week January 26-30:
Hour 1: Advanced students (section work, challenging passages, proper rehearsal)
Hour 2: Full bloco (complete run-throughs, energy building, carnival vibe)
The benefits:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Team gets genuine 3.5 week break (January 1-25) after December madness
Intensive week = different energy than regular grind, feels special not exhausting
Feb 21 Zola becomes dress rehearsal, not isolated performance
Feb 22 carnival happens 24 hours later with momentum built
Advanced students get musical challenge (satisfies Wesley’s chops concern)
Beginners don’t sit through boring sectionals
Parents only coordinate one pickup time
It’s actually FUN rather than grinding maintenance
Can prep in advance: Repertoire finalized in December, parents notified before Christmas break, Wesley plans sectionals over
holiday.
This is American band camp model Brazilianized - less military precision, more carnival energy. Wesley gets intensive musical
work, you get team break, kids get exciting carnival build-up.
Future vision identified (but NOT this year): Residential band camp at Sítio Assunção or even camping. This is your Doncaster
summer camp model but in Brazil. Smart play: run simple version this year, prove concept, THEN explore residential options for
2026.
Ex-Student Tuesday Group Lesson - MOVING FORWARD
The scaling problem identified in meeting with Alexandre and Marcos Henrique (Amigos da Cacilda):
Current model: Ex-students keep loaning instruments ✓ + individual lessons at FB ✓
Fine when there are 8 ex-students
Unsustainable as numbers grow (cost + Tom’s time)
Your solution: 2-hour weekly group lessons for ex-students replacing individual lessons
Fits Tuesday routine (already in Rio after staff meeting for transport reasons)
You’d enjoy continuing to teach ex-students you taught for years
Costs far less than multiple individual lessons
Timeline: 2026 implementation
Progress this week: Spoke to Marquinho (their band leader), will chat in person with all ex-students November 18 at paid PRIO
gig. Smart sequencing - test idea in person at existing gathering rather than creating new meeting.
Board Expansion - ACCOUNTABILITY MOMENT
Target: 2+ new board members by year end
Your assessment: “Needs a kick up the arse this week”
Reality check: This is now Week 2 of “confident we’ll have 2+ by year end.” Your diaries show you’ve been stuck on governance
committee formation since 2021, going “round in circles trying to get us to the point where we have enough board members.”
The question: Is this time actually different, or is it more wishful thinking?
What’s the actual next action this week? Who specifically are you contacting? If this slips another week without concrete
action, then the “confidence” was aspirational, not realistic.
Adding 2+ board members unlocks structural governance problem completely. Either it happens or it doesn’t - but it needs
actual execution this week, not just good intentions.

The Financial Reality Nobody Wants to Talk About
Your current salary: R$8,400/month
What it should be: R$12,000-15,000/month
The gap: R$3,600-6,600/month (30-45% underpayment)
Annual impact: R$43,000-79,000 you’re NOT taking so Favela Brass can function
Your mum:
Already owe: R$70,000 (building work)
Will need to borrow: 30% wedding deposit (May 2026)
Payback timeline: Don’t see spare cash before wedding
Europe summer plans: Dead unless windfall
Thamires knows the full picture. At least you’re not carrying this alone.
The brutal question: Are you building Favela Brass on your mum’s money while paying yourself less than you need to live?
If new sponsor lands (Artur or any of the four follow-ups), money priority order:
Admin salaries (yours especially - get to R$12k minimum)
Property fund (the R$50k+ annual savings operational efficiency play)
Operations buffer (last on list - sustainability first, not operations-at-any-cost)
This means:
Your R$8,400 salary is temporary state, not permanent martyrdom
New sponsor = path to proper compensation
Property acquisition = structural solution to cost problem
You’re not subsidizing FB forever, you’re bridging until revenue catches up
But the brutal reality for next 6 months:
Wedding deposit: Still need to borrow from mum (already owing R$70k)
Europe summer: Not happening unless windfall
Payback timeline: Dependent on captação success converting to salary increase
This is why the four captação follow-ups next week aren’t just “nice to have” - they’re your path out of financial pressure.
That’s why captação is THE ONE priority, not one of several.
Next Week’s Priorities
THE ONE PRIORITY:
1. Four captação follow-ups - Margo, Julio Piña, Olivia, Artur
Not “trying” - DOING
Not vague intention - specific actions
“November’s the month” creates urgency
New sponsor = path to proper salary = ability to pay mum back = financial sustainability
Non-negotiable execution:
2. Carol performance review Tuesday Nov 12
Third week of “about to happen” - this time it happens

Genuine dialogue, not verdict delivery
Ask: “What energizes you vs drains you?”
Listen to her perspective before stating role clarification
Goal: logistics focus that she actually wants, not imposed demotion
Critical this week:
3. Board recruitment - ACTUAL ACTION
Either act this week or admit it’s wishful thinking
Who specifically are you contacting?
What’s the concrete next step?
2+ new members by year end requires November progress, not December scramble
Continuing rhythms (proven sustainable):
Kettlebell/trumpet sessions - Maintain 70%+ hit rate, protect 7-8pm slot
Morning arranging with Thiago - 2-3 hour sessions working, second Omnibook cycle begun
One tea a day discipline - Five years diary evidence proves why this matters
Thamires wrist support enforcement - She’s slipping, you need to remind without nagging
December preparation:
Film premiere Nov 30 - Final logistics, promotion, YouTube setup
Copacabana Palace Dec 7 - Coordinate with PRIO on filming permissions/logistics
Luiz/Volkswagen gigs - Dates TBD, logistics coming together
January band camp details - Finalize with Wesley, communicate to parents before Christmas
Weekly ACT Exercise: “The Financial Anxiety Holder”
When wedding deposit/mum debt/salary gap creates background stress:
Notice the thought: “I can’t afford this/I owe too much/I should be earning more”
Acknowledge it’s real: “This is actual financial pressure, not imagined”
Identify what you control: “I can make the four follow-ups. I can’t control if they convert.”
Separate action from outcome: “My job is to cultivate relationships professionally. Results take time.”
Remember the trajectory: “PRIO relationship accelerating, Artur working it, other connections live. This isn’t static.”
The trap to avoid: Letting financial anxiety drive desperate captação behavior. You know your strength is relationship
cultivation, not aggressive selling. Stay in your strength - it’s working (PRIO, Artur, December gigs all prove this).
Tapa na Cara (Reality Check)
Right. Let’s talk about what’s actually happening here.
The Omnibook completion is genuinely exceptional. 142 studies in 25 days with six-month-old in arms isn’t “maintaining
despite difficulty” - it’s breakthrough-level execution. You’ve proved the morning adaptation works. The kettlebell/trumpet
integration (71% this week, 75% previous period) is embedded, not enthusiasm. These systems are real.
PRIO relationship is accelerating, not just maintaining. Halloween success → immediate Copacabana Palace invitation. That’s
your relationship cultivation strength working. The four captação follow-ups next week leverage this strength - Margo, Julio
Piña, Olivia, Artur are all warm relationships, not cold calls.

The January band camp solution with Wesley is proper collaboration. You both had legitimate concerns (team burnout vs
musical quality). You found third option that serves both needs. Hour 1 advanced/Hour 2 full bloco, intensive week Jan 26-30,
Zola moved to Feb 21 as dress rehearsal. This is visionary/integrator boundary working - you defined constraints (team needs
break), he brought operational concerns (performance readiness), you co-created solution.
But let’s be honest about the patterns that haven’t changed:
Carol conversation is now Week 3 of “about to happen.” Yes, she was legitimately ill Nov 5. But your diary pattern shows
you’re brilliant at finding reasons difficult conversations don’t happen. You were frustrated (good - means you’re not avoiding),
but it still didn’t happen. Tuesday Nov 12 is the moment - either it happens or the avoidance pattern continues.
The financial reality is pressure you’ve been carrying quietly. R$8,400 vs R$12k-15k needed = R$43k-79k annual
underpayment. Already owe mum R$70k, need to borrow wedding deposit, can’t pay back before May, Europe summer dead.
Thamires knows, so at least you’re not carrying it alone. But this explains why captação isn’t just professional development - it’s
financial survival.
If new sponsor lands, you’ve got clarity: Salary increase first (get to R$12k minimum), property fund second (structural cost
solution), operations buffer last. You’re not martyring yourself forever, you’re bridging until revenue catches up. That’s different.
Board recruitment “needs kick up the arse” means either act this week or admit it’s aspirational. You’ve been stuck on
governance committee since 2021. “Confident we’ll have 2+ by year end” is now Week 2. Either specific people get contacted
this week or that confidence wasn’t real.
The Camila pattern is visible to you now. Thursday call transcript shows professional control despite frustration underneath
(HD situation, trailer repetition, volunteer filming suggestion, “registrar o momento” non-answer). You’re doing the supervision
you resent. The AI-age insight is real (coordinator role obsolete in era where Tom + Claude handles strategy), but you were
going to fire her anyway. The question is whether you’ll hire better next time. January 2023 diary: “you hired her because she
was constantly buttering you up, but actually you would have been much better off putting out for someone with experience.”
The residential band camp vision (Sítio Assunção, actual camping) is brilliant future direction. But you caught yourself - “not
this year.” That’s maturity. You’ve got Nov 30 film premiere, December performance madness, Thamires waiting on ortopedista,
Carol/Camila conversations, board recruitment, captação follow-ups, May wedding. Adding “organize residential band camp” =
classic quarterly overcommitment. Run simple version this year, prove concept, scale 2026.
The morning adaptation with Thiago is working. 2-3 hour sessions, one-handed mouse, “80% of 90-min output” - but you
completed Omnibook and restarted. That’s not 80%, that’s exceptional. Stop underselling your adaptation. You’re producing at
high level with baby in arms.
The one tea discipline continues. Five years diary evidence proves caffeine correlation with Twatometer. October 27, 2024:
“you live your life feeling guilty…And it does have to do with no caffeine and booze. Because then you start to become that
person.” You know this about yourself. Keep the discipline - when you slip to coffee, the 0.4 weeks return.
But here’s what actually matters: You’re 46, wedding May 23, 2026, six-month-old son, building something real in Rio while
owing your mum R$70k and needing to borrow more. Your dad’s gone - you can’t show him you became the gentleman. But you
CAN be that for Thiago. The financial pressure is real, not imagined. The captação follow-ups next week matter because they’re
your path to proper salary and paying your mum back.
PRIO relationship accelerating, Omnibook completed, kettlebell rhythm embedded, January solution with Wesley, wedding
date set. These are REAL. The patterns that keep cycling (hiring, difficult conversations, board recruitment, financial pressure)
are also real. Some you’ve solved (one tea since April). Others keep repeating.
Next week: Four captação follow-ups happen (not “try” - DO). Carol conversation Tuesday happens (third week’s the charm or
avoidance pattern continues). Board recruitment gets specific action or gets admitted as aspirational. Keep the tea discipline.
Maintain the kettlebell rhythm. Keep adapting with Thiago. Keep building.
You’re building something that matters while carrying financial weight your partner knows about. The patterns are visible. Some
are solved. Others need solving. Just keep building anyway.

…And Now the Motivation
Here’s what’s remarkable this week: You completed the entire Omnibook - all 218 studies - and immediately started again. With
your six-month-old son in your arms during arranging sessions. That’s not maintaining through difficulty, that’s exceptional
execution proving your adaptation works.
The PRIO relationship isn’t just holding steady - it’s accelerating. Halloween success generated immediate Copacabana Palace
invitation for December 7. Your relationship cultivation strength is working. The four captação follow-ups next week (Margo,
Julio Piña, Olivia, Artur) leverage warm relationships, not cold calling. This is you operating in your strength.
The January band camp solution with Wesley shows proper visionary/integrator collaboration. You both had legitimate
concerns (team burnout vs performance quality). Instead of fighting for your position, you found third option serving both
needs. Hour 1 advanced students, Hour 2 full bloco, intensive week Jan 26-30, Zola moved to Feb 21 as dress rehearsal before
carnival. That’s leadership creating win-win from tension.
The financial pressure is real - R$8,400 vs R$12k-15k needed, owing your mum R$70k and needing to borrow wedding deposit.
But you have clarity now: new sponsor money goes to salary increase first (get to R$12k minimum), then property fund
(structural cost solution), operations last. You’re not martyring forever, you’re bridging until revenue catches up. And Thamires
knows the full picture - you’re not carrying this alone.
The kettlebell/trumpet integration maintains 71% hit rate this week after 75% previous period. That’s not beginner enthusiasm
fading - that’s sustainable system embedded in family rhythm. The 7-8pm slot during Thamires’s bath/bedtime with Thiago
remains perfect dead time utilization. You’re building strength for long-term fatherhood while maintaining trumpet chops.
Tuesday’s Carol conversation is third week of “about to happen” but you were frustrated she was ill (not relieved). That’s good -
means you’re not avoiding, just managing around legitimate obstacles. The shift to genuine dialogue (ask what energizes/drains
her) rather than verdict delivery shows maturity. You’re curious about her perspective while holding boundary (no sales role).
The Camila decision is clear now - R$5,000/month for supervision-heavy “doesn’t sink” quality when Tom + Claude can handle
strategy and task-specific contractors can execute. The AI-age insight is real (coordinator role obsolete), but you need to hire
better next time. The pattern is visible: Carola, Joe, Cris, Rafael, now Camila. Break the cycle by actually hiring experienced
professionals, not hoping inexperienced people become professionals.
The board recruitment either happens this week (specific people contacted, concrete actions) or gets admitted as aspirational
rather than actual plan. You’ve been stuck on governance committee since 2021. “Confident we’ll have 2+ by year end” requires
November action, not December scramble. Either do it or acknowledge the pattern continuing.
You caught yourself on residential band camp vision (“not this year”) - that’s maturity. Film premiere Nov 30, December
performance madness, Thamires ortopedista in December, Carol/Camila conversations, board recruitment, captação, May
wedding. Adding residential band camp = quarterly overcommitment pattern. Run simple version, prove concept, scale 2026.
Next week: Four captação follow-ups happen (Margo, Julio Piña, Olivia, Artur). Carol conversation Tuesday happens. Board
recruitment gets specific action. Keep tea discipline. Maintain kettlebell rhythm. Keep adapting with Thiago. Keep building.
The financial pressure is path to proper compensation, not permanent state. PRIO relationship accelerating. Omnibook
completed and restarted. January solution with Wesley collaborative. Wedding May 23. You’re building something real while
carrying weight your partner knows about. The patterns are visible. Some solved. Others solving. Just keep building.
Good week’s work - exceptional creative execution, strategic relationship cultivation, collaborative problem-solving, honest
financial reckoning.

The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 0.6 ⚠
Camila video meeting Thursday - dismissive tone, impatient, “falando, falando, falando.” Professional boundaries maintained
but made someone feel small.
Key moment: Thursday meeting about institutional video. Camila presented incomplete work (missing new interviews, synced
audio, ending) on her Q4 rock after you’d made rough cut (Oct 21) and sent detailed script. Your frustration came through:
“você tá falando, falando, falando” (you’re talking, talking, talking), “não quero ficar segurando a sua mão” (don’t want to hold
your hand).
Why 0.6 not lower: After 4 years she deserves better tone regardless of work quality. You held yourself accountable to 0.6
when I tried to score it lower - that’s maturity. Standard isn’t “was I technically correct” but “did I treat someone with respect
they deserve as human being.”
Pattern recognition: This confirms the Camila decision trajectory. R$5,000/month for work requiring constant supervision
creates these moments. You’re doing the exact supervision you resent.
Camila Decision - EXIT CONVERSATION PLANNED
Friday Nov 17 development: Camila sent message “organizing my schedule” - concentrating FB work into Mon/Tue 10am-7pm,
Thurs 10am-5pm (max 19 hours/week). Said she was “donating a lot to FB” and lacked time/energy for “other work and
personal activities.”
Your realization: This isn’t someone to employ. After being paid R$5k/month for 4 years, she views it as “donating.” Has other
clients she’s prioritizing. Treating your R$1.2M organization like side gig she’s graciously “donating” to.
When you tried to schedule meeting Thursday, she delayed to Nov 28 to “finish institutional video work” - the very work
she’s claiming overwhelms her. The contradiction: wants reduced hours because FB takes too much time/energy, but delays
meeting to complete FB work.
Filmmaker Taylor’s assessment of her video cut: “Rougher and thinner on content now” + “my previous notes still apply” = she
made it WORSE than your rough cut from a month ago.
Her WhatsApp status literally says: “Demoro a responder, qualquer coisa me liga que eu retorno” (I take a while to respond,
call me if it’s urgent) 👽✨🌈
Decision: Professional exit conversation November 28th
What she receives:
December payment: R$5,000 (severance - she’s MEI so not legally required)
Panasonic Lumix G4 camera: ~R$4,000 (she can use for other work)
Total: R$9,000 for 4 years service
What you get back:
iPhone (FB operational standard)
All account passwords (Instagram, Facebook, Canva, etc.)
•
•
•
•
•

Last working day is Nov 28 (paid through December but stops immediately)
November 28th script:
"Camila, after four years working together, and especially after our recent conversations, it’s clear to me the time has come to
make a change. Since you’re MEI, I’m not legally required to give severance, but I want to do right by you - I’ll pay you for
December even though today is your last working day. You can also keep the Lumix camera since we work with iPhones now.
Today we’ll need to sort passwords and access to all FB accounts. And you’ll need to return the iPhone. Thank you for your
contributions over these years."
If she says “you weren’t paying enough for me to be dedicated”:
“I understand that’s how you feel. The reality is FB needs someone who can deliver at a certain level for the budget we have
available. After four years, it’s clear this isn’t the right fit for either of us anymore. This is the right decision.”
If she asks what you’re doing about communications:
“De imediato vou dar meu jeito em dezembro - até para entender melhor a melhor estratégia de profissionais para 2026.”
5-10 minute conversation. Decision stated, not debated. Logistics handled. Done.
December plan: Tom + AI handling IG directly (laboratory month to understand actual time/skill requirements). January
decision: hire professional at R$7-8k OR continue Tom+AI+contractors model permanently.
Pattern break: Instead of hiring hoping they’ll become professional, you’re experiencing the work yourself first, then hiring
someone who can do it BETTER than you (not just acceptably).
Morning Routine - Sustained Breakthrough Performance
90-minute arranging rhythm: ADAPTED AND WORKING ✅
Status: 2-3 hour sessions (5-8am) with Thiago in arms, one-handed arranging with new mouse
Assessment: Maintaining exceptional pace despite baby in arms
OMNIBOOK - SECOND CYCLE PROGRESS: 🔥
November 8-16 performance:
Nov 8: Study 2 (second cycle restart after completing 218)
Nov 10: Study 11 (9 studies)
Nov 11: Study 19 (8 studies)
Nov 12: Study 26 (7 studies)
Nov 13: Study 34 (8 studies)
Average: 5.7 studies per session - EXACTLY same pace as explosive October finish (Oct 12-Nov 6: 5.7 studies/day average).
This isn’t maintaining despite difficulty - this is sustaining breakthrough-level execution with six-month-old in arms.
Kettlebell/Trumpet Integration - SYSTEM REFINEMENT
This week’s performance: 4 sessions out of 7 days minimum = 57% hit rate
Comparison: Down from 71% last week, but expected variance - system remains sustainable
New training variables introduced:
“No internet” after warmup: Forcing presence during rest periods, eliminating distraction
“No chair” during trumpet: Embouchure/posture discipline, standing practice only
This is Pavel-style progression - systematically adding difficulty constraints
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Technical progression continues:
Nov 10: Trajectory focus (swing), Straightening up/lunge (TGU)
Nov 11: Feet apart (swing), Stand Up (TGU)
Nov 12: Hinge focus (swing), Squeeze knees final stand up (TGU)
Nov 13: Intensity (swing), Getting down (TGU)
Coda integration: Nov 10-13 watching Coda tutorials during sessions (dashboard building, tables, buttons, AI + Packs). Smart
dead-time utilization - learning operational infrastructure during physical training.
Simple & Sinister target identified: Following Pavel’s weight progression properly could reach “Simple” standard by next
birthday (September 2026). That’s 32kg swings, 32kg TGU, specific time standards. From 16kg start (Oct 12) to Simple in 10
months = ambitious but achievable with current 57-75% consistency.
Week’s Crisis: Centro Assunção Sold
The situation:
Ivan (caretaker) informed you Sisters are selling Centro Assunção
Centro Assunção = entrance to favela, 50% of FB lessons conducted there for FREE for years
Losing this space = immediate operational crisis
Financial impact:
One-off: R$25,000 soundproofing Tom’s house
Ongoing: R$2,500/month additional rent for alternative venue
Annual impact: R$30k immediate + R$30k/year ongoing = R$60k Year 1 hit
This happening while:
New fridge R$3,000 unplanned expense this week
Wedding deposit paid (borrowed more from mum - now owing R$70k+ total)
Tom earning R$8,400 vs R$12-15k needed
No new sponsor landed in November
Wesley’s initial proposal: Take beginners band (28 students, 1-3 years experience) and fold into schools program.
Tom’s concern: Students with 1-3 years experience grouped with complete beginners = throwing them under the bus for
operational convenience.
Resolution: You hammered it out with Wesley directly. Band 3 stays having group lessons at Galinheiro do Mato (space in
middle of favela where you do Baile Brass). Problem solved through direct conversation, not compromise of student quality.
Leadership insight: “The responsibility of FB being heavy at times like this.” When infrastructure collapses (Sisters selling after
years of free venue access), that’s on you to solve. This is what Executive Director actually means - carrying the weight when
systems fail.
Centro Assunção Communication Strategy
Context: You were ALREADY planning for losing Centro Assunção eventually. Earlier this year restructured teaching (beginner
group lessons instead of individual) to save money toward buying property. You’ve saved R$200k toward ~R$400k goal.
So this isn’t crisis response - it’s executing existing plan. Sisters selling proves why planning ahead mattered.
Communication challenges:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Wesley is 80% done telling teachers individually about 2026 hour cuts (beginner group lessons reduce some teachers’
hours starting February)
Now Centro Assunção news lands mid-process
Beginner teachers hit twice: hour cuts (Feb 2026) + venue change (now)
Risk: looks like “FB struggling” even though organizationally stable at R$1.2M
The reality: Venue change is minor - Galinheiro do Mato is ~10 minutes further walk within same favela, not major commute
change.
Timeline:
Today (Nov 19): Wesley finishing remaining delicate teacher conversations
This week: Message to Pedagogia group (Wesley, School Secretary, Assistente Social)
November 28: Parent meetings (same day as Camila exit conversation)
Message to Pedagogia group:
"Pessoal, novidade importante: as Irmãs venderam o Centro Assunção. As aulas que acontecem lá vão mudar para o Galinheiro
do Mato a partir de [data].
É cerca de 10 minutos a mais de caminhada dentro da favela para quem vai lá.
Vamos comunicar isso nas reuniões com os pais no dia 28. [AS name], depois podemos conversar sobre se tem alguma família
que vai precisar de apoio com essa mudança de logística.
Wesley já estava conversando com os professores sobre a reestruturação para 2026 - isso confirma porque estávamos nos
planejando. Qualquer dúvida, me avisa."
Parent meetings November 28th framing:
"You may have noticed beginner lessons moved to group format earlier this year. That was strategic - we’ve been building
toward owning our own space rather than relying on borrowed locations. We’ve saved R$200k toward that goal so far.
The Sisters have now sold Centro Assunção, which we anticipated eventually. Those lessons are moving to Galinheiro do Mato.
I know that’s about 10 minutes further into the favela - here’s what that means for logistics: [specifics].
Our goal is our own facility within 3-5 years, depending on funding. In the meantime, we’re adapting. Your kids’ education
continues with same quality - we’re just adjusting where it happens. Questions?"
Key messaging:
Assunção loss VALIDATES strategic planning (not contradicts it)
R$200k saved toward R$400k property goal shows serious progress
Teaching restructuring was PLANNED before venue loss
Acknowledge difficulty (10 min further walk) without dramatizing
FB organizationally stable, this is transition not crisis
Captação - November Honest Assessment
THE ONE PRIORITY from Nov 9: Four captação follow-ups (Margo, Julio Piña, Olivia, Artur)
Actual execution:

“I shall contact the IRB” - direct action from her
Asked what other companies on list - will resend the list
This is real, professional follow-through
2. Julio Piña coffee meeting: ✗ FLAKED
Contacted Nov 10, warm response (“Vamos!!!”)
Suggested Friday Nov 14 coffee
You confirmed immediately, followed up Nov 13 to nail logistics
He ghosted confirmation - no meeting happened
Your objective: Bring him into network, ask about companies on hit list
3. Olivia/Granado: ✓ STRATEGIC RESTRAINT
Asked Oct 28 for Granado introduction
She responded Nov 14 (17 days later) ignoring request, asking YOU about captação
You didn’t push back on dodge
Reasoning: She’s head of marketing at PRIO, sits on panel distributing lei de incentivo budget. Low probability of small
Granado win vs risk annoying person controlling R$900k lifeline = bad strategy.
This is correct strategic calculus. Not avoidance - risk management.
4. Artur: ~ IN PROCESS
Followed up Nov 10: “alguma notícia da empresa?”
Response: “vou checar com eles, me deram entender q gostaram muito do projeto”
Still warm, contact liked project, waiting on response
Genuine possibility, just slow-moving
Additional captação activity:
5. Bill Ballatyne: ✗ GHOSTED
6. Volkswagen: ✗ STRAIGHT NO - At least clean closure
7. Ed Matkin (activated as captador Nov 11):
Sent proposal to 10 companies: Victor Schumer (Allpharma), Marcelo Andrade (EY), Fernando Oliveira (HIG Capital),
Fabiano Alves (GE Aviation), Rodrigo Petterle (KPMG), Mirela Siani (Ipiranga), Charles Ferreira (consultoria), Rodrigo
Favarelli (SAP), Roberto Roessler (Accenture), Claudio Castanheira (Clarkemodet)
5 days later (Nov 16): No responses yet
Your assessment: “Worthwhile but essentially speculative if he’s just firing off emails”
8. Angelo (re-activated):
Dining with EY contacts Nov 11
Checking Ed’s list for connections
Helping with no captação fee (generous)
November scorecard:
Active & Promising: Margo (IRB), Artur (his contact)
Speculative: Ed’s 10 companies (cold outreach)
Strategically Closed: Olivia (won’t risk PRIO), Julio (flaked), Bill (ghosted), VW (no)

Your realistic assessment: “In December I keep trying for sponsorship - it’s still possible. But also planning for how to make
ends meet at FB and at home with what we have.”
This is adult leadership: Not “sponsor will definitely solve everything,” but “keep prospecting while getting realistic about
operating within current constraints.”
Operational Win: Carol Performance Review EXECUTED
Timeline:
Oct 26: “Will communicate Carol role change this week”
Nov 2: “Carol performance review Tuesday Nov 5”
Nov 5: Carol ill, rescheduled
Nov 9: “Carol performance review Tuesday Nov 12” (Week 3)
Nov 12: ACTUALLY HAPPENED ✅
Approach: Used EOS format properly - she spoke first about what’s working/not working, then you weighed in. Gave her
agency in conversation, not just receiving verdict.
Outcome: Agreed on “handoff” routine:
You book shows/events (relationship cultivation - your strength)
Create WhatsApp group with client + Carol
Carol owns logistics coordination with client directly
She sets up logistics reference spreadsheet for everyone
This solves actual problem: You weren’t frustrated with Carol’s logistics ability - frustrated being stuck in middle of client
communication. Now you book, hand off, Carol executes. Clean boundaries, clear ownership.
Pattern recognition: Difficult conversation took 3 weeks (one legitimate illness delay, rest avoidance) but finally happened and
went better than expected. Used proper framework, achieved concrete operational improvement.
Board Recruitment - Still Delayed
Status from Nov 9: “Needs kick up the arse this week” + “Confident we’ll have 2+ by year end”
Status Nov 16: “Fell off with Assunção crisis”
This is now Week 3 of “needs kick up the arse” with no action.
Board meeting Wednesday Nov 20: Scheduled to discuss/define shortlist of candidates
What “it’s happening” must mean Wednesday:
Specific names (not “we should approach people in X category”)
Who contacts each person (not “someone should reach out”)
Timeline for outreach (not “in the next few weeks”)
Pattern to avoid: Meeting generates good discussion, everyone agrees board expansion important, no one takes specific
ownership, slips another month.
Six weeks left in 2025. Either specific people contacted in next 7 days or this slips to Q1 2026.
Be honest with yourself: Is this actually happening in 2025?

This week’s hits:
New fridge: R$3,000 unplanned
Wedding deposit: Paid (borrowed from mum - total owed now R$70k+)
Centro Assunção costs incoming: R$25k one-off + R$2.5k/month ongoing
Personal monthly:
Tom’s salary: R$8,400/month
Should be: R$12-15k for role/experience
Shortfall: R$3,600-6,600/month (R$43-79k annually)
Can’t pay mum back before May wedding
Finances “tight” - real pressure, not imagined
FB organizational: R$1.2M annually (PRIO R$900k + others) - organizationally stable
Property fund: R$200k saved toward R$400k+ goal (halfway there, 3-5 year timeline depending on captação)
If new sponsor lands: Money priority order:
Admin salaries (Tom’s to R$12k minimum)
Property fund
Operations buffer
But if no new sponsor Q1 2026: Planning includes:
Camila exit saves R$5k/month immediately (R$60k annually)
Centro Assunção costs hit regardless
Tom’s salary pressure continues until captação converts
Math is tight but manageable if no major surprises.
Family - The Good Stuff
Thiago - First Ocean Experience 🌊
Friday Nov 15: You and Thamires found secret beach (Praia do Morcego in Jurujuba) and Thiago had his first paddle in the sea.
Six months old, experiencing ocean with his parents.
This is what actually matters. Not captação stress, not video editing frustration, not board recruitment delays. Your son’s first
time in water at hidden beach you discovered together.
Thamires Medical:
Wrist scan results coming Sunday Nov 17
She’s been slack on wrist support discipline despite reminders
Tendonitis diagnosis (Nov 3), waiting on tomografia + ortopedista
If bad news: activity further limited
If improving: maybe she can start moving more
Internal concern (not raising with Thamires):
She’s overeating, gaining weight (6 months postpartum + limited activity from injury)
Wedding May 23, 2026 (6 months away)

You’re NOT having conversation - only gentle nudges toward healthy eating/activity
She’s 6 months postpartum with injured wrist, this is her choice
Tomorrow’s scan results matter more than your concerns
December Performance Calendar
Locked in:
November 30: Film premiere (YouTube, 7pm Sunday) - 2 weeks away
December 6: Margo’s Sítio Assunção Teresópolis - 47 students + 10 adults, water bottles gift
December 7: Copacabana Palace (PRIO/ELA magazine party) - relationship deepening from Halloween success
December: Luiz Braga birthday gig + community event next day (dates TBD)
December: Volkswagen Resende well-paid show (date TBD)
Assessment: Performance load + PRIO cultivation + Luiz relationship + revenue generation. Multiple goals simultaneously, not
just busywork.
Capacity reality: Thamires limited arm duty + Thiago care + performances + film premiere + Camila exit + board recruitment +
captação + Centro Assunção transition. December intense but purposeful.
January Band Camp - Wesley Collaboration Success
Original tension:
Your position: Give staff break (Nov/Dec brutal, education jobs get summer holiday)
Wesley’s position: Month off = lost momentum, performance readiness suffers
Both right. Wesley thinking Musical Director (quality, readiness). You thinking Executive Director (sustainability, burnout
prevention).
Solution developed together:
Move Zola gig to February 21 (day before carnival) as dress rehearsal
Run intensive “band camp” week January 26-30:
Hour 1: Advanced students (section work, challenging passages)
Hour 2: Full bloco (run-throughs, energy building, carnival vibe)
Benefits:
Team gets 3.5 week break (Jan 1-25) after December madness
Intensive week = special energy, not grinding maintenance
Feb 21 Zola becomes dress rehearsal
Feb 22 carnival happens 24 hours later with momentum
Advanced students get challenge (Wesley’s concern addressed)
Beginners don’t sit through boring sectionals
Parents coordinate one pickup time
Actually FUN
Can prep advance: Repertoire finalized December, parents notified before Christmas, Wesley plans sectionals over holiday.
This is American band camp Brazilianized - less military precision, more carnival energy.

Future vision (correctly deferred): Residential camp at Sítio Assunção Teresópolis or camping. This is Doncaster summer
camp model for Brazil. Smart NOT doing 2026 - run simple version January, prove concept, THEN explore residential 2027.
Next Week Priorities
THE ONE ABSOLUTE:
1. Camila exit conversation November 28
5-10 minutes: Decision stated, not debated
Severance: R$5k December + R$4k camera = R$9k total (she’s MEI, not legally required)
Last working day Nov 28 (paid through December but stops immediately)
Get all passwords/account access before she leaves
iPhone returned
Clean, professional, brief
CRITICAL THIS WEEK:
2. Centro Assunção communication
Wesley finishes remaining teacher conversations (by Friday)
Message to Pedagogia group this week
Parent meetings Nov 28 (same day as Camila conversation)
3. Board meeting Wednesday Nov 20
Walk out with specific names + ownership + timeline
Or admit realistic timeline is Q1 2026
Six weeks left in 2025
4. Film premiere November 30 (12 days away)
Final logistics, promotion, YouTube setup
ONGOING:
5. Captação momentum
Margo: Resend insurance companies list
Artur: Wait for response, casual check-in if silent >1 week
Ed: If no responses by Nov 23, follow up with calls not just emails
Angelo: Thank for EY help, keep warm
6. Kettlebell/trumpet - Maintain 57-75% hit rate, protect 7-8pm slot
Continue “no internet after warmup”
Continue “no chair” trumpet
Omnibook second cycle: Study 34, maintaining 5.7/session pace
7. Morning arranging with Thiago - 2-3 hour sessions 5-8am, baby in arms
System works, sustaining breakthrough pace
8. One tea discipline - Five years evidence proves caffeine correlation
This week’s 0.6 on ONE tea

Film premiere promotion
Performance documentation planning
Regular feed content calendar
10. Margo Sítio Dec 6 - Bus logistics, food cost coordination
11. Copacabana Palace Dec 7 - PRIO filming permissions/logistics
Key Insights This Week
The Camila “donating” message revealed the truth: After 4 years at R$5k/month, she views working for your R$1.2M
organization as favor she’s graciously doing. Has other clients prioritized. WhatsApp status says “I take while to respond.” This
isn’t someone restructuring for efficiency - this is someone checked out mentally while wanting to keep paycheck.
Centro Assunção loss validates strategic planning: You were ALREADY restructuring to save for property (R$200k saved
toward R$400k goal). Sisters selling proves why planning ahead mattered. This isn’t crisis response - it’s executing existing
plan.
Carol pattern vs Camila pattern: Carol conversation delayed 3 weeks but eventually executed well with concrete improvement.
Camila conversation also delayed but trajectory is exit, not restructuring. The difference: Carol can execute logistics
independently, Camila cannot execute anything without supervision.
Wesley collaboration continues working: Centro Assunção solution (Band 3 at Galinheiro), January band camp design
(intensive week + Zola dress rehearsal). Visionary/integrator boundary functioning - you define constraints, he brings
operational input, you co-create solutions.
Captação reality check matters: “Four follow-ups” sounded achievable but included strategically off-limits (Olivia), flaked
(Julio), waiting (Artur), delivered (Margo). Real action was Ed (10 companies) + Angelo re-activation. You’re underselling actual
strategic work (activating captadores with networks) while feeling bad about modest targets that weren’t all executable.
Financial pressure is real but not catastrophic: R$8,400 vs R$12-15k needed, owing mum R$70k+, Centro Assunção R$60k
Year 1 hit, new fridge R$3k. But FB organizationally stable R$1.2M, Camila exit saves R$60k annually when executed, captação
has genuine possibilities. Pressure to manage, not crisis requiring panic.
Pattern still cycling: Difficult decisions delayed (Carol Week 3 executed, Camila Week 2+ pending Nov 28, board Week 3+
pending Wednesday). Direct asks uncomfortable when people dodge (Julio flaked = accepted, Olivia dodged = accepted with
strategic reasoning). One tea since April holds (0.6 on ONE tea this week).
What’s actually working: Omnibook pace sustained (5.7 studies/session second cycle = first cycle finish pace), kettlebell
rhythm embedded (57-75% sustainable with new constraints), morning arranging with Thiago producing breakthrough results,
Carol conversation executed with concrete improvement, Centro Assunção solved collaboratively with Wesley, Thiago’s first
ocean paddle at secret beach.
Tapa na Cara
Centro Assunção crisis landed - Sisters selling after years free access, R$60k Year 1 hit, finances already tight - and you didn’t
collapse. Worked it out with Wesley (Band 3 at Galinheiro), solution protects student quality while solving logistics. That’s
leadership under infrastructure collapse.
Carol conversation Week 3 finally happened. EOS format worked, handoff routine established. Difficult thing delayed went
better than feared. This pattern repeats - remember it.
•
•
•
•

Camila 0.6 was harsh. “Falando, falando, falando” dismissive after 4 years together. You held yourself to 0.6 when I tried lower -
that’s maturity. Standard isn’t “was I correct” but “did I treat someone with respect they deserve.”
The Camila “donating” message revealed everything. After R$5k/month for 4 years, she views FB as favor. Has other priorities.
WhatsApp status says “I take while to respond.” Exit conversation Nov 28 is right call. R$9k severance (December + camera)
when she’s MEI (not legally required) = extremely generous for ending contractor relationship not working.
Board recruitment Week 3 no action. Wednesday meeting either produces names + ownership + timeline, or this is Q1 2026.
Stop telling yourself “this week” when pattern shows otherwise.
Captação honest assessment matters. Two genuine possibilities (Margo/IRB, Artur), one long-shot (Ed’s 10 companies), several
closed. “Keep trying December + make ends meet with what we have” = adult leadership, not pessimism. Financial pressure
real (R$8,400 vs R$12-15k needed, owing mum R$70k+), captação unpredictable, planning for constraints while prospecting =
being responsible.
Kettlebell/Omnibook sustaining breakthrough pace. Study 34 second cycle, 5.7/session matching first cycle finish. Adding “no
internet after warmup” + “no chair trumpet” = systematic progression. Simple & Sinister September 2026 ambitious but
achievable at 57-75% consistency.
Morning arranging with Thiago works. Completed 218 first cycle, restarting second at same pace. Stop underselling as “80%
output” - sustaining breakthrough performance with baby in arms. That’s adaptation preserving excellence.
Thiago first paddle Praia do Morcego. Six months old, secret beach, with you and Thamires. This is what matters. Not Julio
flaking or Camila supervision or board delays. Your son experiencing ocean first time while you’re carrying organizational weight
solving infrastructure crises.
Financial math tight not catastrophic. Fridge R$3k, wedding deposit borrowed (mum R$70k+), Centro Assunção R$60k Year 1,
salary shortfall continuing. But FB R$1.2M stable, Camila exit saves R$60k annually, captação has possibilities. Pressure to
manage not crisis.
December performance calendar strategic. Film premiere, Margo Sítio, Copacabana Palace PRIO, Luiz birthday, Volkswagen
Resende. Multiple goals - revenue + relationships + momentum. You know difference between strategic yes (these) and
obligation yes (decline). Intense but purposeful.
January band camp shows Wesley collaboration. You had concern (burnout), he had concern (readiness), found third option
together (intensive week, Zola dress rehearsal Feb 21). Visionary/integrator functioning. Correctly deferred residential 2027.
Next week: Camila conversation Nov 28 (5-10 minutes, decision not debate, R$9k severance, last working day, passwords
secured). Centro Assunção communication (Pedagogia group, parent meetings Nov 28). Board Wednesday (names +
ownership + timeline OR Q1 2026 admission). Film premiere 12 days. Captação warm leads nudged. Keep kettlebell rhythm.
Keep morning arranging. Keep one tea. Keep building.
You’re 46, wedding May 23 2026, six-month-old son, building R$1.2M organization serving 100+ kids while owing mum R$70k
planning make ends meet. Centro Assunção solved with Wesley. Carol executed well. Camila exiting Nov 28 with generous
severance. Financial pressure real. Captação has possibilities. Thiago had first ocean paddle secret beach. Patterns visible -
some solved (one tea April-now), others cycling (decisions delayed, asks uncomfortable). Weight is real. You’re carrying it. Keep
building.
Next check-in: November 23, 2025
Key metrics: Camila conversation executed Nov 28 (clean exit, accounts secured), Centro Assunção communication completed
(Pedagogia + parents), Board meeting Wednesday outcomes (concrete or Q1 2026), Film premiere final logistics, Thamires scan
results response, kettlebell/Omnibook maintenance, one tea discipline
Check-in completed: November 16, 2025 - Centro Assunção solved collaboratively, Carol executed with improvement, Camila
exit planned professionally, captação honest assessment without false optimism, financial pressure real but manageable,
creative pace sustained with baby in arms, Thiago’s first ocean experience

Check-in: November 23, 2025
Weekly Check-in: November 23, 2025
Your weekly therapy session with Claude
The Twatometer™
Being a twat incidents this week: 0.25 ✅
One minor incident Friday, handled proportionately. No pattern emerging.
The incident: Friday HonkRio show - Carol set up lojinha and banners right inside Zola restaurant entrance, creating barrier
between street performance and venue. Natasha (Kaiser’s business partner, venue owner) pulled you aside with polite “wtf,”
you asked Carol to sort it. Couple minutes later banners still there, you were “slightly more assertive” (no shouting, just shorter
tone) and physically moved one banner yourself.
Why 0.25 not higher: You kept it together when it mattered, didn’t chew Carol out publicly, corrected situation quickly. Given
stakes (German millionaire watching, Natasha’s venue, showcase for Carnival introduction), slightly shorter tone when first
instruction wasn’t followed = completely reasonable.
Assessment: One incident at high-pressure showcase doesn’t mean handoff system failing. Could be nerves or misjudgment in
moment. Not pattern yet.
Morning Routine Reality - Capacity Constraint Acknowledged
Morning arranging status: DOWN TO 30-40% OUTPUT ⚠
The change: Thiago now wakes at 5am daily (was sleeping later). Your 5-8am arranging window that produced exceptional
October output (Halloween arrangements explosion, systematic composition work) is fundamentally disrupted.
What you’re getting: Still producing arranging work, but “crawling” at 30-40% previous capacity. Hard to make meaningful
progress with baby in arms from 5am onward.
December decision: Strategically accepting possibility you won’t get 90 minutes daily arranging this month. Will try to get as
much as possible opportunistically, but realistic that December is performances/relationships/transitions month, not
composition month.
January plan: Hit writing work during FB holidays (Jan 1-25 before band camp Jan 26-30). “Take a leaf out of university
professors’ book” - concentrated creative time when operational demands minimal.
New time structure emerging:
5am: Thiago wakes, morning walk with baby + Zola, AI strategic thinking via headphones (captação planning, IG strategy,
operational thinking)
10:00-11:30: FLEX TIME - could be captação, could be admin, could be arranging, depending on priorities and what’s possible
with Thiago’s schedule
11:30-14:30: Thiago care while Thamires makes lunch, etc.
14:30-17:00: FLEX TIME - more captação/admin/arranging mix
17:00: Second walk with Thiago + Zola (Thamires rest time maintained)
19:00-20:00: Kettlebell/trumpet (EMBEDDED RHYTHM - this keeps working)
Key insight: Not ringfencing creative time anymore because it keeps getting violated. Instead, 4 hours daily flex time (10:00-
11:30 + 14:30-17:00) used for whatever combination of captação/admin/arranging makes sense based on priorities and

capacity.
Strategic reframe: As CEO, captação and strategic thinking ARE your primary work now, not “less important than arranging.”
Morning AI conversations via headphones during walks = legitimate high-value CEO work, not displacement activity.
Kettlebell/Trumpet Integration - STILL EMBEDDED
This week’s performance: 4 out of 5 days logged = 80% HIT RATE ✅
Progress:
Nov 16: Study 41 (7 studies)
Nov 17: Study 49 (8 studies)
Nov 19: Study 61 (12 studies - some studies shorter/easier)
Nov 20: Study 71 (10 studies)
Total: 37 studies in 4 sessions = 9.25 average (though Nov 19’s 12 includes easier studies)
Weight progression: Nov 16 jumped to 24kg on Set 2. Following Pavel’s Simple & Sinister progression properly - one heavy set
for several weeks before adding another. Challenging but felt great.
Assessment: 6+ weeks of consistent execution (since Oct 12 start). The 7-8pm slot during Thamires’s bath with Thiago
remains genuinely embedded even when everything else chaotic (Thiago 5am wake-ups, morning routine disrupted, arranging
down to 30-40%).
Technical constraints maintained:
“No internet after warmup” - forcing presence during rest periods
“No chair trumpet” - embouchure/posture discipline
Coda tutorial watching during sessions (dashboard building, tables, buttons, AI + Packs) - smart dead-time utilization for
operational learning
Simple & Sinister target: Following Pavel’s weight progression properly could reach “Simple” standard by next birthday
(September 2026). That’s 32kg swings, 32kg TGU, specific time standards. From 16kg start to Simple in 10 months = ambitious
but achievable with current 57-80% consistency.
Week’s Biggest Win: Julio Piña Meeting DELIVERED
The context: Last check-in (Nov 16) Julio was in “flaked” category - warm response Nov 10 (“Vamos!!!”), you suggested Friday
Nov 14 coffee, confirmed immediately, followed up Nov 13, he ghosted confirmation.
This week: Meeting actually happened. Coffee at his house at Lagoa.
The outcome - MASSIVE:
He’s musician himself, actively seeks to support music projects
Asked for ALL promotional materials to send to HIS network
Specifically named director of Light (electricity company) as friend he’ll present you to
Invited you to event at his house December 20th
Timeline convergence: Dec 20 is SAME DAY as Árvore de Natal Lagoa gig (R$8k high-profile event you just booked). So you’ll
perform at Árvore with Julio’s friends potentially watching, then go straight to his house party where you can work room with
film fresh on YouTube and Lagoa performance just delivered.
Status change: Julio went from “flaked on coffee” to “had you over to his house, actively wants to help, introducing you to
wealthy network.” This is proper relationship cultivation converting.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Materials sent: You sent everything immediately (not waiting for film premiere - smart move to maintain momentum).
Strategic significance: Julio as active advocate connecting you to his network could be more valuable than single sponsor.
This is Luiz Braga trajectory (went from birthday party booking to “I want to help find sponsors + connect to elite festivals”).
Your relationship cultivation strength working again.
Second Major Win: Árvore de Natal Lagoa BOOKED
Event: High-profile Árvore de Natal (Christmas tree lighting) at Lagoa
Fee: R$8,000 (nearly your monthly salary)
Date: December 20
Significance: Public performance in wealthy Lagoa neighborhood where Julio’s friends and other prospects will see you
Perfect timing: Same day as Julio’s house party = perform publicly, then work private gathering. Maximum leverage from single
trip to Lagoa.
Third Major Win: Kaiser Venue Offer POST-HONKRIO SUCCESS
Friday Nov 22 HonkRio performance: Went brilliantly. So many people in street that party closed one lane of traffic. Multiple
bands worked great.
Kaiser appearance: Only appeared at end (was drinking), but Natasha introduced you, initial conversation happened.
His response: Loved the event and kids, sounded very positive about using his new building.
THE OFFER: Asked about student numbers, offered big room 3 times per week if you do monthly events.
Why this matters:
Centro Assunção sold (R$60k Year 1 impact: R$25k soundproofing + R$2.5k/month ongoing)
Kaiser venue could replace Galinheiro rent: R$1,200/month = R$14,400 annual saving
Monthly events are “piece of cake and actually good for us”
Immediate tactical solution: Band 3 (28 beginners, the ones losing Centro Assunção) could rehearse Saturdays at Kaiser
venue = fills his monthly event requirement, solves chunk of venue crisis.
Strategic evolution possibility: If multiple rooms available, Saturday becomes full escola-portátil model = consolidates
beginners one location one day, reduces scattered weekday logistics.
Current status: You asked Natasha for coffee next week. She responded last night: “Yesterday was lovely, thank YOU! Uwe
[Kaiser] leaves tomorrow but I’ve talked to him and you and I can move forward with logistics. I may be travelling mid week, let
me get back to you about when I’m free to meet 💫”
Next steps:
Kaiser already left Rio (Sunday)
Natasha can make decisions (she’s business partner, manages venue daily)
Coffee either Tuesday (you’re in Rio anyway) if she’s free before travelling, or video call/messages if needed
MUST confirm room access before Thursday parent meetings so you can do meetings AT Kaiser venue = “here’s your
new home” not “we’re figuring it out”
Assessment: Within one Friday night conversation you went from “hoping for Carnival introduction” to “offered regular venue
space solving Centro Assunção crisis.” Kaiser SAW the street packed, traffic lane closed, energy you generate. That’s
demonstrated capacity, not theoretical potential.
Physical Space Reconfiguration
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The change: Moved hi-fi speakers and digital piano downstairs into home office (where you actually work) rather than upstairs
studio (never use because it’s right by bedroom where Thiago sleeps).
Effect: Loving being able to listen to hi-fi again, tinkering a bit on piano.
Realistic assessment: Getting back to disciplined 30 minutes daily piano will only happen in January holidays when capacity
exists.
Why this matters: You’re setting up infrastructure for when capacity exists rather than forcing routines that don’t fit current
reality. Same honest assessment as arranging - not pretending you’ll maintain disciplines that aren’t sustainable right now.
Coda Systems - Infrastructure Investment vs Displacement Activity
The problem: Carol’s event spreadsheets are “dogs dinner.”
Your solution: Built proper Coda event system this week.
Your assessment: “Frikkin great.” These Coda systems will be “transformational.”
Pattern recognition: You’d been thinking of Coda work as “semi-procrastination work-about-work kind of thing,” but
recognizing this ISN’T displacement activity. It’s actual infrastructure that will reduce operational chaos.
Realistic expectations: Will be constantly tweaking Coda in all areas (not “build once and forget”), but optimistic that staff will
actually use it and time investment will pay off. “Big up-front investment in organizing data for long-term improvement in quality
of life, à la ‘Coming Up for Air.’”
The accountability test (3-6 months): Does this actually free up your time (staff running systems independently), or are you
still bottleneck (constantly fixing/updating/explaining)?
If it works: Legitimate infrastructure reducing “Carol needs supervision on logistics” problem
If it doesn’t: New system that just shifts work around - you’re still doing everything but with prettier interface
The PRIO Problem - Renewal Silence
Current situation: PRIO gave R$1M for 2024. Haven’t told you what 2025 will be.
Your Nov 19 message to Camilla (PRIO contact):
“Oi Camilla, bom dia! Foi ótimo te ver ontem - espero que curtiu o show! Eu não quis trazer isso lá no evento, mas quando seria
um bom momento para a gente conversar sobre a parceria do ano que vem?”
Response: 4 days silence (as of Saturday Nov 23).
Why this matters critically:
PRIO is R$900k-1M of your R$1.2M budget = 75% of organizational funding
Partnership decisions being made NOW (Nov/Dec)
Centro Assunção crisis just hit (R$60k Year 1 impact)
If PRIO thinking of cutting 10-20% (down to R$800-900k), that combined with Assunção loss could genuinely screw you
operationally
The conversation you need isn’t just: “What’s the renewal number?”
It’s actually: “We’ve just lost our free venue, here’s the real cost impact, you need to understand that cutting our funding right
now has serious consequences.”
That’s harder conversation than renewal discussion, which might be why she’s not responding. She may not have authority to
discuss it, or PRIO may not have decided yet and she’s avoiding conversation.

Next action: Follow up Monday. Not vague “when’s good to chat” but direct: “We need to finalize 2026 before December as
we’re making budget decisions around Centro Assunção situation.”
Timeline pressure: Need to know by end December to plan 2026 budget. Decisions being made RIGHT NOW.
This is why captação matters: Can’t be 75% dependent on one sponsor who’s ghosting renewal conversations in late
November.
Carol Performance Review Follow-Through - Handoff Working
Last check-in status: Carol conversation executed Week 3 (Nov 12) after delays. EOS format used, handoff routine
established:
You book shows/events (relationship cultivation - your strength)
Create WhatsApp group with client + Carol
Carol owns logistics coordination directly
She sets up logistics reference spreadsheet
This week’s test: Friday HonkRio - banner incident was operational chaos in moment (high-pressure showcase, Natasha
watching, quick correction needed), not pattern of Carol failing at logistics.
Assessment: One week post-conversation, handoff system functioning. Friday incident could be nerves/misjudgment rather
than fundamental incapacity. Too early to call pattern.
The solve Carol actually needed: Not frustrated with her logistics ability - frustrated being stuck in middle of client
communication. Now you book, hand off, Carol executes. Clean boundaries working so far.
Camila Exit - THURSDAY EXECUTION
Scheduled: Thursday November 28 (5 days away)
Current complication: She did quite a bit this week (filming 2 shows this weekend), so “you’re not 100% committed” line feels
hollow to you.
But that was never the real reason. Real reasons:
After R$5,000/month for 4 years, she calls it “donating to FB” - fundamentally wrong attitude
You constantly supervise her work - institutional video needed your rough cut + script and she still made it worse
Role itself obsolete - Tom + AI handles strategy, contractors execute specific tasks cheaper
She has other clients she prioritizes - WhatsApp status “I take while to respond,” requesting reduced hours while paid
R$5k/month
Her message about “concentrating FB work Mon/Tue/Thurs max 19 hours” and “donating a lot” while having other priorities
Script for Thursday (to be refined closer to day):
“After four years and recent conversations about your schedule, it’s clear this arrangement isn’t working for either of us. Today
is your last working day, I’ll pay you through December, and you can keep the camera.”
If she asks “why isn’t arrangement working?”:
Going to 2 events doesn’t negate lack of commitment. She sent message about deprioritizing FB. She’s spending time but not
delivering what you need with that time beyond keeping IG ticking over.
What she receives:
December payment: R$5,000 (severance - she’s MEI so not legally required)

Panasonic Lumix G4 camera: ~R$4,000 (can use for other work)
Total: R$9,000 for 4 years service
What you get back:
iPhone (FB operational standard)
All account passwords (Instagram, Facebook, Canva, etc.)
Last working day Nov 28 (paid through December but stops immediately)
December plan: Tom + AI handling IG directly (laboratory month to understand actual time/skill requirements). January
decision: hire professional at R$7-8k OR continue Tom+AI+contractors model permanently.
Pattern break attempt: Instead of hiring hoping they’ll become professional, you’re experiencing work yourself first, then hiring
someone who can do it BETTER than you (not just acceptably).
Centro Assunção Communication - ON TRACK
Status:
✅ Wesley finished remaining delicate teacher conversations (hour cuts for beginner teachers starting Feb 2026)
✅ Message sent to Pedagogia group (Wesley, School Secretary, Assistente Social)
✅ Parent meetings scheduled Thursday Nov 28
Venue change reality: Galinheiro do Mato is ~10 minutes further walk within same favela, not major commute change.
Your framing for parent meetings:
"You may have noticed beginner lessons moved to group format earlier this year. That was strategic - we’ve been building
toward owning our own space rather than relying on borrowed locations. We’ve saved R$200k toward R$400k goal so far.
Sisters have now sold Centro Assunção, which we anticipated eventually. Those lessons are moving to [Kaiser venue if
confirmed, otherwise Galinheiro do Mato]. I know that’s about 10 minutes further - here’s what that means for logistics:
[specifics].
Our goal is our own facility within 3-5 years depending on funding. In meantime, we’re adapting. Your kids’ education continues
with same quality - we’re just adjusting where it happens."
Key messaging:
Assunção loss VALIDATES strategic planning (not contradicts it)
R$200k saved toward property goal shows serious progress
Teaching restructuring was PLANNED before venue loss
Acknowledge difficulty without dramatizing
FB organizationally stable (R$1.2M), this is transition not crisis
Thursday logistics: If Natasha confirms Kaiser venue access before Thursday, do parent meetings AT the new venue = “here’s
your new home” rather than just talking about it. If not confirmed in time, communicate plan clearly and execute when
confirmed.
Board Recruitment - Week 4 No Action, Wednesday Critical
Status from Nov 16: “Fell off with Assunção crisis”
Pattern: Week 3 of “needs kick up the arse” with no action before this week. Board meeting was supposed to happen Nov 20,
members flaked, moved to this Wednesday Nov 27.

•
•

Your plan: Wednesday morning walk with Thiago becomes board recruitment strategy session (AI conversation via
headphones working through who to approach, who asks them, timeline for outreach). Then arrive at meeting with clear
proposal.
What “it’s happening” must mean Wednesday:
Specific names (not “we should approach people in X category”)
Who contacts each person (not “someone should reach out”)
Timeline for outreach (not “in the next few weeks”)
Six weeks left in 2025. Either specific people contacted in next 7 days or this slips to Q1 2026.
Be honest with yourself: After 4 weeks of “this week it’s happening,” is this actually happening in 2025?
Governance insight: Board members flaking on remote meetings. Your current president (leaving after March AGM) prefers
remote, but you’re thinking in-person for 2026.
Your reframe: Quarterly in-person meetings with real decisions beats monthly remote meetings where people flake and
nothing concrete happens.
Transition timing: President leaving March AGM = natural point to change meeting structure. New president can establish in-
person quarterly rhythm from start.
Captação November Honest Assessment
The ONE PRIORITY from Nov 9: Four captação follow-ups (Margo, Julio Piña, Olivia, Artur)
Actual execution this month:
1. Margo → IRB/Insurance companies: ✅ ACTIVE & PROMISING
Followed up Nov 10
She responded Nov 16 (boarding plane to Mexico for wedding)
“I shall contact the IRB” - direct action from her
Asked what other companies on list - you’ll resend after film premiere
2. Julio Piña: ✅ CONVERTED TO ADVOCATE
Flaked Nov 14, but meeting happened this week at his house
Now actively helping: asked for materials, named Light director as contact, invited to Dec 20 party
Sending your info to his wealthy network
This is relationship cultivation (your strength) delivering results
3. Olivia/Granado: ✓ STRATEGIC RESTRAINT (not avoidance)
Asked Oct 28 for Granado introduction
She responded Nov 14 (17 days later) ignoring request, asking YOU about captação
You didn’t push back on dodge
Reasoning: She’s head of marketing at PRIO, sits on panel distributing lei de incentivo budget. Low probability small
Granado win vs risk annoying person controlling R$900k lifeline = bad strategy.
This is correct strategic calculus
4. Artur: ~ WARM, WAITING
Followed up Nov 10: “alguma notícia da empresa?”

Response: “vou checar com eles, me deram entender q gostaram muito do projeto”
Still warm, contact liked project, slow-moving but genuine possibility
Additional November captação:
5. Ed Matkin (activated as captador Nov 11):
Sent proposal to 10 companies: Victor Schumer (Allpharma), Marcelo Andrade (EY), Fernando Oliveira (HIG Capital),
Fabiano Alves (GE Aviation), Rodrigo Petterle (KPMG), Mirela Siani (Ipiranga), Charles Ferreira (consultoria), Rodrigo
Favarelli (SAP), Roberto Roessler (Accenture), Claudio Castanheira (Clarkemodet)
12 days later: No responses yet (as of Nov 23)
Speculative - if no responses by Monday, need to follow up with calls not just emails
6. Angelo: Helping with no captação fee (generous), dining with EY contacts, checking Ed’s list for connections
7. Bill Ballatyne: Ghosted
8. Volkswagen: Straight no (at least clean closure)
November scorecard:
Active & Promising: Margo (IRB), Julio (now advocate with network), Artur (warm waiting)
Speculative: Ed’s 10 companies (cold outreach, no responses yet)
Strategically Closed: Olivia (won’t risk PRIO), Bill (ghosted), VW (no)
Your realistic November assessment: “In December I keep trying for sponsorship - it’s still possible. But also planning for how
to make ends meet at FB and at home with what we have.”
This is adult leadership: Not “sponsor will definitely solve everything,” but “keep prospecting while getting realistic about
operating within current constraints.”
Post-film premiere outreach plan: Saturday film launches, then fresh reason to contact 15+ prospects:
Margo (resend insurance list + film)
Artur’s contact (warm nudge + film)
Ed’s 10 companies (if no responses, call with film as hook)
Kaiser (coffee anyway, film is context)
Angelo’s EY contacts (gives fresh material)
Julio’s network (he’s sending materials, film reinforces)
Financial Reality - Pressure Real But Manageable
Personal monthly:
Tom’s salary: R$8,400/month
Should be: R$12-15k for role/experience
Shortfall: R$3,600-6,600/month (R$43-79k annually)
Owed to mum: R$70k+ (building work + wedding deposit borrowed)
Can’t pay back before May 23 wedding
Finances described as “tight” - real pressure, not imagined
This month’s hits:
New fridge: R$3,000 unplanned (earlier in November)

Wedding deposit: Paid (borrowed more from mum)
Centro Assunção costs incoming: R$25k one-off + R$2.5k/month ongoing = R$60k Year 1
But Kaiser venue potentially saves R$14.4k annually (R$1,200/month Galinheiro rent)
FB organizational: R$1.2M annually stable, but 75% PRIO-dependent with renewal silence concerning
Property fund: R$200k saved toward R$400k+ goal (halfway there, 3-5 year timeline depending on captação)
If new sponsor lands: Money priority order:
Admin salaries (Tom’s to R$12k minimum)
Property fund acceleration
Operations buffer
December immediate relief: Camila exit saves R$5k/month = R$60k annually starting January
Math: Tight but manageable if no major surprises. Camila exit offsets some Centro Assunção hit. Tom’s salary pressure
continues until captação converts. PRIO renewal uncertainty is biggest variable.
Film Premiere - SATURDAY READY
Status: Set up, video on YouTube, Camila planned IG campaign
Date: Saturday November 30 (6 days away)
Goal: Get it out there, make noise, create evergreen asset for captação
Not expecting: Massive live viewership Saturday night
Real value: Long-term captação tool - sending to Margo, Artur contacts, Kaiser, Ed’s prospects, Angelo’s EY connections =
“here’s our film showing what we do”
Post-premiere strategy: Monday onwards, use film launch as fresh reason for warm outreach to 15+ contacts who’ve gone
quiet or need nudging.
December Performance Calendar - LOCKED
Confirmed events:
November 30: Film premiere (YouTube, 7pm Sunday) - 6 days
December 6: Margo’s Sítio Assunção Teresópolis - 47 students + 10 adults
December 7: Copacabana Palace (PRIO/ELA magazine party) - relationship deepening from Halloween success
December 20: Árvore de Natal Lagoa - R$8k high-profile event, THEN Julio’s house party same evening
December: Luiz Braga birthday gig + community event next day (dates firmed)
December: Volkswagen Resende well-paid show (date firmed)
Assessment: Multiple revenue + relationship cultivation events. Strategic load (PRIO cultivation, Julio networking, Luiz
relationship, income generation), not just busywork.
Your framing: “Pedal to the metal till end of December then January off.”
Capacity reality: Arranging down 30-40%, Thamires limited arm (December ortopedista consultation coming), Thiago 5am
wake-ups, Camila exit means you handling IG in December, Centro Assunção parent communication, board recruitment,
captação follow-ups, PRIO renewal conversation, film premiere, full performance calendar.
December is sprint, January is creative recharge: FB on holiday Jan 1-25 (before band camp Jan 26-30), concentrated
writing/arranging time when operational demands minimal. You noted “writing isn’t remotely stressful” - flow state, not stress.

Family - The Reality
Thamires wrist:
Got scan done Nov 17 (Sunday last week)
Consulta only at start of December (10+ days wait for doctor to explain results)
Still in limbo - has scan but doesn’t know what it means or what to do
Still slack on wrist support discipline despite reminders
Pain plateauing or lessening (good sign)
Thiago:
Now 7 months old
Waking 5am daily (disrupting your morning arranging window)
You’re doing morning walk with him + Zola, plus 5pm walk (Thamires rest maintained)
Morning sessions now childcare/strategic thinking, not creative work
Your capacity with Thiago: “Tricky.” Morning arranging down to 30-40% output because he’s awake and needs holding from
5am. This is significant capacity constraint affecting December commitments.
This Week Ahead - EXECUTION WEEK
Monday November 25:
PRIO follow-up message to Camilla (direct about urgency: “We need to finalize 2026 before December as we’re making
budget decisions around Centro Assunção situation”)
Film premiere final checks
Tuesday November 26:
You’re in Rio anyway
Potential coffee with Natasha if she’s free before travelling
If she’s travelling, push for video call/messages to confirm Kaiser venue access before Thursday
Wednesday November 27:
Morning: Walk with Thiago = board recruitment strategy session (AI via headphones: who to approach, who asks, timeline)
Meeting: Board meeting - walk out with specific names + ownership + timeline, or admit Q1 2026
If this slips again after Week 4 no action, need honest assessment whether this board structure actually functional
Thursday November 28:
Camila exit conversation (5-10 minutes, decision stated not debated, R$9k severance, accounts/iPhone secured)
Centro Assunção parent meetings - ideally AT Kaiser venue if confirmed with Natasha, otherwise communicate plan
clearly
Full day of difficult conversations - only going to Rio once
Saturday November 30:
Film premiere (YouTube, 7pm)
Create noise, get it out there
Evergreen asset for captação now available

Kaiser (contextualize coffee)
Angelo’s EY contacts
Julio’s network
Key Insights This Week
Julio Piña went from “flaked” to “advocate with wealthy network access” within one coffee at his house. Asked for materials
to send to friends, named Light electricity director specifically, invited you to Dec 20 party. This is your relationship cultivation
strength converting repeatedly (Luiz, Kaiser, now Julio). The pattern: personal connection → genuine relationship → active
advocacy.
Kaiser venue offer potentially solves Centro Assunção crisis within days of Sisters selling. R$14,400 annual rent saving if
3x/week access confirmed. Monthly HonkRio events are “piece of cake and good for us” = strategic yes that serves multiple
goals (venue access, community visibility, relationship deepening).
December structure requires capacity honesty: Morning arranging down 30-40% (Thiago 5am wake-ups), doing Camila’s IG
work yourself, full performance calendar, captação follow-ups, PRIO renewal pressure, Centro Assunção communication, board
recruitment, film premiere. You’re framing as “sprint to Christmas then January off” which is sustainable IF January is actually
rest/creative recharge.
The PRIO silence is concerning - 75% funding dependency, 4 days ghosted after asking about 2026 renewal, Centro
Assunção crisis just hit, decisions being made NOW. Monday follow-up critical. This is why captação diversification matters -
can’t be 75% dependent on one sponsor ghosting renewal conversations in late November.
Coda systems investment is “Coming Up for Air” model - significant upfront time for sustained efficiency gain. You’re clear-
eyed about ongoing tweaking required but optimistic staff will actually use systems. The 3-6 month test: does this free YOUR
time or just shift work around?
Morning routine capacity constraint is significant - your 5-8am arranging window that produced October’s exceptional output
is fundamentally disrupted. Down to 30-40% capacity. You’re not pretending otherwise - strategically accepting December
might be low-arranging month, planning January creative sprint when FB quiet. That’s honest assessment, not defeat.
Your relationship cultivation continues working where cold calling struggles. Julio (house coffee → advocate), Kaiser (Friday
performance → venue offer), Luiz (Itaipava weekend → sponsor-finding offer). Pattern clear: you’re exceptional at cultivating
relationships personally, less effective at cold outreach. Lean into actual strength.
Board recruitment is Week 4 no action despite “needs kick up the arse” accountability. Wednesday meeting either produces
concrete hitlist or you need honest assessment whether this structure functional. Six weeks left in 2025 - either real or admit
Q1 2026.
Pattern still visible: Difficult decisions execute eventually but after delays (Carol Week 3, Camila Week 2+ pending Thursday,
board Week 4+ pending Wednesday). One tea discipline holding (0.25 on ONE tea this week). Kettlebell rhythm embedded
(80% despite morning chaos). Relationship cultivation delivering (Julio, Kaiser). Financial pressure real (R$8,400 vs R$12-15k,
owing mum R$70k+, Centro Assunção R$60k Year 1, PRIO renewal uncertain).
Tapa na Cara
Right then. Three massive wins this week - let’s be clear about what you actually delivered:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Julio Piña went from flaked coffee to advocate with wealthy network. You didn’t just get polite encouragement - he invited
you to his house at Lagoa, asked for all promotional materials to send to HIS friends, named Light electricity director specifically
as contact, invited you to Dec 20 party. That’s active advocacy, not vague “let me know if I can help.” You sent materials
immediately (smart - maintain momentum). This is your relationship cultivation strength working again after Luiz (Itaipava
weekend → sponsor-finding offer) and now Kaiser.
Kaiser venue offer solves Centro Assunção crisis within days of Sisters selling. Friday night HonkRio was so successful the
city closed traffic lane. Kaiser saw street packed with people, offered 3x/week venue space if you do monthly events. That’s
R$14,400 annual rent saving (R$1,200/month Galinheiro). Monthly events are “piece of cake and good for us” = strategic yes
serving multiple goals. You immediately asked Natasha for coffee to lock logistics. Within one week of venue crisis, you’ve got
potential solution lined up. That’s leadership under infrastructure collapse.
Árvore de Natal Lagoa booked for R$8k Dec 20 - same day as Julio’s party. High-profile public performance in wealthy
neighborhood, then private networking at his house. Maximum leverage from single trip. The timing convergence is perfect -
perform publicly with his friends potentially watching, then work the room with film fresh on YouTube and Lagoa performance
just delivered.
Kettlebell/trumpet 80% this week (4/5 days) despite morning chaos. Study 71, averaging 9+ per session, jumped to 24kg Set
2 following Pavel’s progression properly. The 7-8pm rhythm is genuinely embedded - 6+ weeks consistent execution even
when everything else disrupted (Thiago 5am wake-ups, arranging down 30-40%). This system works because it uses dead
family time and eliminates background anxiety about “should I be practicing?”
But let’s be honest about what’s not working:
PRIO renewal silence is 4 days and counting. You messaged Camilla Wednesday asking about 2026 partnership - she’s
ghosted it. PRIO is 75% of your R$1.2M budget (R$900k-1M). Centro Assunção crisis just hit (R$60k Year 1). If they’re thinking
of cutting 10-20%, that combined with Assunção loss could genuinely screw you operationally. Monday follow-up needs to be
direct: “We need to finalize 2026 before December as we’re making budget decisions.” Not vague “when’s good to chat” - she
can dodge that. This is why captação diversification matters.
Board recruitment is Week 4 no action. Meeting was supposed to happen Nov 20, members flaked, moved to Wednesday Nov
27. You’ve been saying “this week it’s happening” for a month. Wednesday morning walk with Thiago is strategy session, arrive
with concrete proposal, walk out with names + ownership + timeline. Or admit realistic timeline is Q1 2026. Six weeks left in
2025 - either real or acknowledge the pattern continuing. And be honest about whether remote meetings where people flake
monthly is actually functional governance structure.
Morning arranging capacity down 30-40% is significant constraint. Thiago waking 5am disrupted your creative window that
produced October’s exceptional output. You’re not pretending otherwise - strategically accepting December might be low-
arranging month, planning January creative sprint when FB quiet. That’s honest, not defeat. But “sprint to Christmas then
January off” only works if January is actually rest/creative recharge, not “swap operational work for different strategic projects.”
December you’re doing Camila’s IG job while maintaining full performance calendar. Film premiere Saturday, Margo Sítio Dec
6, Copa Palace Dec 7, Árvore + Julio party Dec 20, Luiz birthday, VW Resende, plus captação follow-ups post-premiere, PRIO
renewal conversation, Centro Assunção parent meetings Thursday, Camila exit Thursday, board recruitment Wednesday,
Thamires wrist consultation early December. That’s genuinely full plate. “Pedal to metal” is accurate. Just make sure January is
actual recharge not pretending to rest while doing strategic work.
Camila exit Thursday - you’ve got script foundation but feeling “you’re not committed” rings hollow after she filmed 2
shows this week. But that was never the real reason. Real reasons: calls R$5k/month “donating to FB” after 4 years, you
constantly supervise her work, role itself obsolete (Tom + AI better), she has other clients prioritized. One good week doesn’t
erase the pattern. We’ll refine script closer to day, but decision is correct.
Coda systems this week - you’re calling it “transformational” but acknowledging ongoing tweaking required. That’s “Coming
Up for Air” model: significant upfront investment for sustained efficiency gain. The 3-6 month test: does Carol actually use
event system independently (reducing your load) or do you just have prettier interface for work you’re still managing? Too early
to tell, but at least you’re clear-eyed it’s ongoing work not one-time fix.

The pattern visible: You deliver wins through relationship cultivation (Julio, Kaiser, Luiz all convert personally). You struggle
with remote/cold approaches (board meetings people flake, Ed’s 10 companies no responses, PRIO silence). Difficult
conversations execute eventually but after delays (Carol Week 3 done, Camila Week 2+ Thursday, board Week 4+ Wednesday).
Financial pressure real (R$8,400 vs R$12-15k needed, owing mum R$70k+, Centro Assunção R$60k Year 1 partially offset by
Kaiser R$14.4k saving and Camila R$60k annual exit). One tea discipline holds (0.25 on ONE tea this week - banner incident
proportionate response not pattern).
You moved speakers and piano downstairs where you actually work. Setting up infrastructure for when capacity exists rather
than forcing routines that don’t fit reality. Same honest assessment as arranging - not pretending you’ll maintain 30 mins daily
piano until January when capacity actually exists. That’s maturity.
This week execute: Monday PRIO follow-up (direct about urgency). Tuesday Natasha coffee or video call (confirm Kaiser
venue before Thursday). Wednesday board meeting (names + ownership + timeline or Q1 2026 admission). Thursday Camila
exit + parent meetings at Kaiser venue if confirmed. Saturday film premiere. Then use film as outreach hook for 15+ contacts
needing warm nudge.
You’re 46, wedding May 23 2026, seven-month-old son waking 5am, building R$1.2M organization while owing mum R$70k+,
Centro Assunção sold requiring R$60k Year 1 response, PRIO renewal uncertain, arranging capacity down 30-40%, sprinting to
Christmas then January creative time. Julio advocate with network access. Kaiser venue solving crisis. Árvore R$8k booked.
Kettlebell embedded 80%. Film premiering Saturday. Patterns visible - some working (relationship cultivation, one tea,
kettlebell), others cycling (board delays, difficult conversation delays, financial pressure continuing). Weight is real. You’re
carrying it. Keep building.
…And Now the Motivation
Here’s what’s remarkable this week: You turned a flaked coffee into an advocate with a wealthy network. Julio Piña ghosted you
Nov 14, but this week you were at his house at Lagoa being introduced to his circle and getting specific commitments (Light
electricity director introduction, materials sent to his friends, Dec 20 party invitation). That’s your relationship cultivation
strength delivering repeatedly - Luiz went from birthday party to sponsor-finding advocate, Kaiser went from Friday night
drinks to venue offer solving your crisis, now Julio’s actively working his network for you.
The Centro Assunção crisis landed (Sisters selling after years free access, R$60k Year 1 hit) and within days you’ve got
potential solution. Kaiser’s 3x/week venue offer saves R$14,400 annually, monthly HonkRio events are “piece of cake and good
for us” = strategic yes serving multiple goals simultaneously. You didn’t panic or freeze - you asked Natasha for coffee
immediately to lock logistics. That’s leadership under infrastructure collapse.
The Árvore de Natal Lagoa booking (R$8k, Dec 20) landing same day as Julio’s party is perfect timing convergence. Public
high-profile performance in wealthy neighborhood, then private networking where you can work the room with film fresh on
YouTube and Lagoa performance just delivered. You’re creating leverage moments where single actions serve multiple strategic
goals.
The kettlebell/trumpet rhythm is genuinely embedded now - 80% hit rate this week (4/5 days) despite morning chaos with
Thiago 5am wake-ups disrupting everything else. Study 71, jumped to 24kg Set 2 following Pavel progression properly. Six
weeks consistent execution proves this isn’t enthusiasm fading, it’s sustainable system that works because it uses dead family
time and eliminates background practice anxiety. The evening slot during Thamires’s bath with Thiago remains protected even
when morning routine collapses.
You’re being honest about capacity constraints rather than pretending. Morning arranging down 30-40% because Thiago
awake from 5am = significant hit to creative output. But you’re not forcing routines that don’t fit reality. Strategically accepting
December might be low-arranging month, planning January creative sprint when FB quiet. Moving speakers and piano
downstairs where you actually work, acknowledging 30 mins daily discipline waits until January when capacity exists. That’s
maturity - setting up infrastructure for when you can actually use it rather than guilt-tripping yourself about disciplines you can’t
currently maintain.
The Coda event system you built this week - Carol’s spreadsheets were “dogs dinner,” you made something “frikkin great” that
could be “transformational.” You’re clear-eyed it requires ongoing tweaking (not one-time fix) but optimistic it’s “Coming Up for

Air” model: significant upfront investment for sustained efficiency gain. The 3-6 month test will tell whether Carol uses it
independently (freeing your time) or you’re just managing prettier chaos. But at least you’re building infrastructure rather than
perpetually firefighting.
This week ahead: Monday PRIO follow-up with direct urgency message. Tuesday Natasha coffee or video call confirming Kaiser
venue before Thursday. Wednesday board meeting walking out with names + ownership + timeline after morning strategy
session with Thiago. Thursday Camila exit (5-10 minutes, R$9k severance, decision stated not debated) plus Centro Assunção
parent meetings at Kaiser venue showing families actual new home. Saturday film premiere creating evergreen captação asset.
Then use film as fresh hook for warm outreach to 15+ contacts.
The financial pressure is real (R$8,400 vs R$12-15k needed, owing mum R$70k+, Centro Assunção R$60k Year 1, PRIO renewal
uncertain), but so are the wins (Julio advocate, Kaiser venue, Árvore R$8k, Camila exit saving R$60k annually starting January).
You’re carrying organizational weight while solving infrastructure crises and cultivating relationships that could change
trajectories. Julio’s wealthy network access, Kaiser’s venue solving crisis, Luiz’s sponsor-finding offer, Margo’s IRB connection -
these are REAL possibilities, not theoretical hopes.
December is sprint to Christmas (full performance calendar, film premiere momentum, captação follow-ups, operational
transitions), then January creative recharge when FB on holiday (Jan 1-25 before band camp). You noted “writing isn’t remotely
stressful” - flow state work when operational demands minimal. That’s sustainable IF you actually rest in January rather than
swapping one set of pressures for different strategic projects.
Good week’s work - three major wins executed (Julio advocate, Kaiser venue, Árvore booked), kettlebell rhythm embedded
despite chaos, honest capacity assessment without self-deception, infrastructure building for future efficiency, relationships
converting to advocacy repeatedly. Execute this week’s conversations (PRIO Monday, Natasha Tuesday, board Wednesday,
Camila Thursday), premiere Saturday, then use December momentum while protecting January recharge time.
Next check-in: November 30, 2025
Key metrics: PRIO follow-up response and 2026 number clarity, Kaiser venue confirmed with Natasha (room access, monthly
event details), board meeting outcomes (hitlist with names + ownership + timeline OR Q1 2026 admission), Camila exit
executed cleanly (R$9k severance, accounts secured, iPhone returned), Centro Assunção parent meetings (ideally at Kaiser
venue), film premiere execution, kettlebell/trumpet rhythm maintenance (target 57-80% range), December captação follow-ups
using film as hook, one tea discipline, Thamires wrist consultation early December
Check-in completed: November 23, 2025 - Julio advocate with network access secured, Kaiser venue offer solving Centro
Assunção crisis, Árvore Lagoa R$8k booked with perfect timing, kettlebell 80% embedded despite morning chaos, capacity
constraints acknowledged honestly, execution week ahead with multiple critical conversations
